# Canonical Examples

Reference transcripts showing expected behavior patterns. Use these as few-shot examples for consistent system behavior.

| Example | Domain | Demonstrates |
|---------|--------|--------------|
| [coo-loi-generation.md](coo-loi-generation.md) | COO | Skill invocation, template usage, file naming |
| [cmo-newsletter-creation.md](cmo-newsletter-creation.md) | CMO | Draft, edit, publish workflow |
| [cross-domain-content.md](cross-domain-content.md) | Both | Operations learning becomes content |
| [edge-cases/ambiguous-request.md](edge-cases/ambiguous-request.md) | - | Clarification before action |
| [edge-cases/multi-domain-task.md](edge-cases/multi-domain-task.md) | Both | Domain handoff protocol |

## How to Use These Examples

1. **For Claude:** These demonstrate expected interaction patterns
2. **For Humans:** Reference when training new workflows
3. **For Debugging:** Compare actual behavior against expected

---

## Adding New Examples

When a new pattern emerges that should become canonical:

1. Create new `.md` file in appropriate location
2. Follow the transcript format (User/Claude alternating)
3. Include "Key Behaviors Demonstrated" section
4. Add to index table above
