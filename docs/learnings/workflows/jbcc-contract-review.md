# JBCC Contract Review Workflow
> Last updated: 2025-11-30

## Overview

Review and analyze JBCC (Joint Building Contracts Committee) contracts for construction projects. South African standard form contracts.

## Context

JBCC contracts are the standard in South African construction. Key variants:
- JBCC Principal Building Agreement (PBA)
- JBCC Minor Works Agreement
- JBCC Nominated/Selected Subcontract Agreement

## Pre-Flight Checks

1. Identify contract variant
2. Check for amendments/special conditions
3. Note parties involved

## Steps

### 1. Initial Review
- Identify contract edition/version
- Note all parties and their roles
- Check completion date and contract period
- Identify contract value

### 2. Key Clauses to Review

| Clause Area | What to Check |
|-------------|---------------|
| Payment | Terms, retention, interim certificates |
| Variations | Procedure, valuation, time implications |
| Extensions | Grounds, notification requirements |
| Penalties | Delay damages, calculation method |
| Practical Completion | Criteria, handover requirements |
| Defects Liability | Period, rectification process |

### 3. Risk Identification
Flag any:
- Unusual amendments to standard clauses
- Onerous conditions
- Missing standard protections
- Unclear definitions

### 4. Output
Create summary document with:
- Contract overview
- Key dates and values
- Risk register
- Recommendations

## Common Pitfalls

- Don't assume standard clauses haven't been amended
- Check for special conditions section carefully
- Verify edition matches understanding of terms
- Confirm which JBCC variant is being used

## Tools

- COO doc-analyzer agent for initial parsing
- Cross-reference with JBCC standard commentary
