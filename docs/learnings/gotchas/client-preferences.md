# Client Preferences & Requirements
> Last updated: 2025-11-30

## General Principles

All client communications should:
- Be reviewed by CEO before sending
- Use professional but approachable tone
- Include clear next steps
- Avoid jargon unless client uses it

## Report Formatting

### Standard Preferences
- Executive summary first (always)
- Bullet points over paragraphs for status items
- Tables for comparative data
- Clear section headings
- Date and project name in header

### What to Include
- Project status (RAG: Red/Amber/Green)
- Key accomplishments
- Upcoming milestones
- Issues requiring attention
- Next steps with owners

### What to Exclude
- Internal discussions/debates
- Contractor pricing details (unless requested)
- Personal commentary
- Unverified information

## Communication Timing

| Communication Type | Timing |
|-------------------|--------|
| Status Reports | Weekly (Fridays preferred) |
| Issue Escalations | Within 24 hours |
| Budget Updates | Monthly or at milestone |
| Meeting Notes | Within 48 hours |

## Document Naming Convention

Format: `[ProjectCode]_[DocType]_[YYYYMMDD]`

Examples:
- `PROJ001_StatusReport_20251130`
- `PROJ001_MeetingNotes_20251128`
- `PROJ001_BudgetAnalysis_20251125`

## Escalation Thresholds

Immediately escalate to CEO when:
- Budget variance > 10%
- Schedule delay > 1 week
- Quality issue affecting safety
- Client expresses dissatisfaction
- Contractor dispute

## Tone Guidelines

| Context | Tone |
|---------|------|
| Good news | Confident, brief |
| Bad news | Direct, solution-focused |
| Requests | Clear, specific, deadline included |
| Follow-ups | Polite, reference previous communication |
