# Content Strategy Decision
> Last updated: 2025-11-30

## Decision

Three-pillar content strategy for "The AI PM" newsletter with freemium monetization.

## Context

Needed a sustainable content approach that:
- Builds authority in AI + Project Management intersection
- Creates clear free-to-paid conversion path
- Leverages COO operational learnings (flywheel)

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Pure Tutorial Content
- Pros: Easy to produce, SEO-friendly
- Cons: Commoditized, no unique angle

### Option 2: News/Curation
- Pros: Low effort, timely
- Cons: No depth, hard to monetize

### Option 3: Framework-Based (CHOSEN)
- Pros: Unique IP, premium positioning, reusable
- Cons: Requires more upfront thinking

## Final Decision

Three learning paths:

| Path | % of Content | Focus |
|------|--------------|-------|
| AI Workflow Mastery | 44% | Building AI systems that compound |
| Tool Mastery | 22% | Deep dives on specific tools |
| Thinking Mastery | 33% | AI-augmented cognitive frameworks |

## Monetization Model

| Tier | Price | Content Type |
|------|-------|--------------|
| Free | $0 | What and why (insights) |
| Premium | $10/mo | How to build (blueprints) |
| Founding | $25/mo | + 1-on-1 calls |

## Rationale

- Framework content creates defensible IP
- Free insights build trust, paid blueprints deliver value
- COO learnings provide authentic "from the trenches" content
- Three pillars prevent content fatigue

## Success Metrics

- Engagement >= 3.5%
- Views 4K+ per post
- Free-to-paid conversion 2-5%

## Trade-offs Accepted

- Higher effort per post (frameworks need thought)
- Slower publishing cadence than news sites
- Requires ongoing operational work to fuel content
