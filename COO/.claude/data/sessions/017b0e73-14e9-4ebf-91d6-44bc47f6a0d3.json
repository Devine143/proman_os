    "compare this to To create and structure CLAUDE.md files for a large repository, use a multi-tiered approach that combines a global file at the root level and concise, focused files within key subdirectories or modules. This lets Claude Code load relevant documentation only where needed, keeping context precise and the AI\u2019s guidance accurate for large, complex projects.\u200b\n\nCore Principles and Structure\nRoot-Level CLAUDE.md (Project Scope):\n\nPlace a CLAUDE.md in the repository root.\n\nDocument overall architecture, core coding guidelines, major dependencies, and entry points for the project.\n\nInclude setup instructions, common bash commands, naming conventions, CI/CD pipelines, and key contacts or contributor guidelines.\n\nLink out to more detailed docs (architecture diagrams, setup guides) rather than embedding long text\u2014summarize and reference path.\u200b\n\nModule and Subsystem CLAUDE.md (Scoped Knowledge):\n\nAdd CLAUDE.md files to large subdirectories or modules: e.g., frontend/CLAUDE.md, backend/CLAUDE.md, api/CLAUDE.md.\n\nDocument only what is specific to that module: internal architecture, APIs, utility scripts, module-specific testing, local conventions.\n\nEmphasize links to external or supporting files (schemas, integration docs) rather than repeating global information.\u200b\n\nHierarchical Loading and Merging:\n\nClaude Code automatically loads CLAUDE.md files in the current directory, then up the folder hierarchy recursively, merging context from most specific to broadest.\n\nThis means updates at any level immediately affect agent behavior, and nested files don't override but supplement higher-level ones.\u200b\n\nBest Practices\nKeep Files Concise: Avoid monolithic files; each CLAUDE.md should be lean and focused to optimize context window usage. Reference external docs for depth.\u200b\n\nDocument Critical Paths: Use clear headers like \u201cArchitecture Map,\u201d \u201cTesting Guide,\u201d \u201cCommon Workflows.\u201d Document frequently used APIs, patterns, or troubleshooting steps.\n\nCross-link Key Resources: Point to important design docs, problem/solution guides, and configuration files. Use relative paths for portability.\u200b\n\nModular Updates: Update module CLAUDE.md files when changing internals, while keeping the root CLAUDE.md for overarching changes.\n\nEnable Team Coordination: Note who maintains each CLAUDE.md and encourage contributors to log changes and share solutions.\n\nBootstrap with /init: On new or legacy repos, run /init to auto-generate a baseline CLAUDE.md file, then edit for accuracy.\u200b\u200b\n\nExample Structure\ntext\n/CLAUDE.md\n  # Overall project architecture\n  # Coding standards\n  # Common CLI commands\n  # Project setup instructions\n  # Key subsystem references\n  # Links to major docs\n\n/frontend/CLAUDE.md\n  # Frontend architecture overview\n  # UI style guides, theming\n  # State management practices\n  # Frontend test instructions\n  # Links to component docs\n\n/api/CLAUDE.md\n  # API design and routing\n  # Authentication/authorization notes\n  # API test coverage guidelines\n  # Links to OpenAPI specs\n\n/shared-utils/CLAUDE.md\n  # Shared utilities documentation\n  # Helper function notes\n  # Troubleshooting patterns\nThis approach makes it easy for Claude Code to find key information while respecting context window limits, and enables modular maintenance for large, multi-file repositories.\u200b to the '/Users/donovan/AGENT/docs/MEMORY-OVERHAUL-PLAN.md'"
