    "# Project Charter\n## 11 Buck Street Mixed-Use Development\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** 13 November 2025\n**Status:** Draft\n**Project Reference:** PC-2025-001\n**Location:** Turtle Creek, Paarl, Quils River, Western Cape\n\n---\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nThis Project Charter formally authorizes the 11 Buck Street mixed-use development project, a landmark new-build construction located in the Turtle Creek region of Quils River. The project represents a significant investment in the central hub of the precinct and will become the tallest building in Quils River upon completion.\n\nThe development comprises 5 levels including basement and structured parking (3 levels), 4 levels of residential units, and 2 levels of office space with amenities. The project is strategically positioned as a gateway to the Stellenbosch farms, set against a backdrop of distant mountains, and will serve as a bridge between future commercial spaces and existing residential homes.\n\nThe project is expected to be completed within 12-24 months at an estimated budget exceeding R100 million. This investment will deliver long-term value to stakeholders through a mixed-use development designed for retention rather than immediate sale.\n\n**Key Project Parameters:**\n- **Project Type:** New Build (Mixed-Use Development)\n- **Total Levels:** 5 (Basement/Parking + Residential + Commercial)\n- **Estimated Duration:** 12-24 months\n- **Budget Range:** > R100 million\n- **Target Completion:** Q4 2027 (estimated)\n\n---\n\n## 1.
