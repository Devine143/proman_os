Please run /doctor if this is unexpected. \n    Otherwise, run `claude mcp` or visit \n    https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp to learn more.\n\n> claude mcp \n\n\u23fa I see you're looking at MCP (Model Context Protocol) configuration. The\n  /mcp command shows no servers are currently active, but I notice there's\n  an untracked .mcp.json file in the project. Let me check what's in it:\n\n\u23fa Read(.mcp.json)\n  \u23bf  Read 29 lines\n\n\u23fa You have an .mcp.json file configured with 3 MCP servers:\n\n  | Server         | Purpose                   |\n  |----------------|---------------------------|\n  | firecrawl-mcp  | Web scraping/crawling     |\n  | perplexity-ask | Perplexity AI search      |\n  | omnifocus      | OmniFocus task management |\n\n  However, Claude Code isn't detecting them. A few things to check:\n\n  1. File location: The .mcp.json is in /Users/donovan/PROMAN_OS/COO/.\n  Claude Code looks for MCP config in:\n    - Project root (.mcp.json)\n    - User home (~/.claude/mcp.json or ~/.claude/.mcp.json)\n  2. Restart needed: After adding MCP config, you typically need to restart\n   Claude Code for it to pick up the servers.\n\n  Quick options:\n\n  - Run /doctor to diagnose configuration issues\n  - Restart Claude Code (Ctrl+C then claude again) to reload MCP servers\n  - Move config to home if you want these servers available globally:\n  ~/.claude/.mcp.json\n\n  Would you like me to help troubleshoot or move the configuration?\n\n> /doctor \n  \u23bf  Claude Code diagnostics dismissed\n\n> /doctor \n  \u23bf  Claude Code diagnostics dismissed ultrathink",
