    "I've been thinking about my business system that we are building and would\n  like to use subagents as different departments in my busienss that handle\n  different things. We have a two tired system at the moment, knwledge base of\n  existing project for contesxt and a operations system to follow up on the day\n  to day things that need to be done. What subagents would you suggest? ",
    "Save this to md. Once done give me a comprehensive plan with excurating deal on how you would implement into my current system and how confident you are it will work and increase the system as a whole ",
    "Why do we start wiht the omnifocus export are we not talking about the operations manger agent?",
    "before we get going with the agent, I have changed the script a little for the export and started using tags like High priorty, and giving dates for completion to have something to work for. Not one do I use a waiting for tag. Can we make sure we are using the right catergories first before starting the operations agent",
    "use the '/Users/donovan/AGENT/scripts/sync-omnifocus.py' to see what tagging and infmaton I have ",
    "1.Can the agent automatically add the time estmiate.Follow up email will be about 3 to 5 mintues, same for calls et.2 yes please autmatically do that in omnifocus files so I can see them clearly if I open up onmifocus app manually. 3 Option a for now.4 agent to convert to full dates",
    "have a look at the agent docs and make sure you've followed best practices'/Users/donovan/AGENT/ai_docs/sub-agents.md'",
    "when create agents for this system always create subagents - refernce this in the claude.md so in future we don't try running a script agent. Also deleted all script agents docs",
    "What's on my plate?",
    "The subagent isn't being recognized by the Task tool. Let me read\n  the latest OmniFocus data directly and generate your chase list:\\\n\\\nwhy did this happen? "
