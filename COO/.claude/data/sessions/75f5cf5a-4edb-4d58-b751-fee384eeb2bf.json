    "save this to docs for future reference - The best way to manage context in \"Claude code,\" particularly within the Claude-Flow configuration system, involves two primary strategies: structured configuration via the CLAUDE.md file, and strategic semantic code retrieval for large codebases.\n1. Context Management via Structured Configuration (CLAUDE.md)\nThe CLAUDE.md file is considered the \"heart of Claude-Flow configuration,\" providing essential context, constraints, and coordination patterns for AI-powered development.\nWithin the standard structure of a CLAUDE.md template, context management is explicitly handled in the dedicated section:\n\u2022 \ud83e\udde0 MEMORY MANAGEMENT: This specific section of the template structure dictates how context is maintained and utilized. The key components managed here are:\n    \u25e6 Context storage patterns.\n    \u25e6 Decision tracking.\n    \u25e6 Knowledge persistence.\nFurthermore, the overall project context is defined under the \ud83c\udfaf PROJECT CONTEXT section, which specifies the project type and goals, the technology stack, and architecture decisions, all of which provide high-level context for the AI.\n2. Strategic Context Retrieval for Code (Scalability)\nFor managing context in large repositories, such as those reaching a million lines of code, the sources emphasize strategic retrieval to prevent \"Token Blowups\". These practical tactics ensure the context remains precise and affordable:\n\u2022 Map the Terrain in CLAUDE.md: You should include a top-level map of subsystems within the CLAUDE.md file. This map should outline components like api/, web/, services/, shared/, and tests/, along with common dependency edges and \"hotspots\" that are frequently prone to breaks.\n\u2022 Prefer Glob/Grep Before Dumping Code: Instead of including large amounts of code directly, the recommended approach is to ask the agent to use grep or glob to search for symbol usage and list candidate files. The agent should then only open the 3\u20135 most relevant files"
