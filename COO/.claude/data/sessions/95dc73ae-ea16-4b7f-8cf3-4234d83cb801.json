    "@agent-procurement-manager please can you help me with negotation with WBHO , the idea is to have them do this small project now, create a relationship so they can do the big project that we've got coming up pretty soon.",
    "'/Users/donovan/Archive/AGENT/projects/11_Buck_Road' is the project",
    "Let's walk through the questions. So WBHO will be the main contractor and with the JBCC.The larger project is 81 Church Street. It's almost a billion rand project. Confirm status is in design stage at the moment, very early. So we've got a year or two to actually do the planning and then get on to site.WBHO is probably the best construction company in Cape Town, South Africa, at the moment. Doke and I are business partners who previously worked with them, so we know what they are about and what they do. With them being the biggest and the best, we want to make sure that the contract is done properly and accordingly.A strategic position. We obviously want to use the big project as a tool to try and get them to come in a little bit lower, but it shouldn't be the first thing that happens.Well, we have expressed their best interest that we go to negotiation with WBHO before going out to open tender. The idea is to try and get WBHO within our budget, which will prevent us from going to tender for other contractors. And like I said before, we tried to create a relationship with them for the big ones.If WBHO declines, we can't do it. We will go through to the tender process with a number of other contractors.Success definition is definitely having WBHO on board within budget and within our time frame.",
    "That took over 30 minutes, what are some ways to speed this up?"
