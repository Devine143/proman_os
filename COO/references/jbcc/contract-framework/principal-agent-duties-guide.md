# JBCC Principal Agent Duties Guide

## Overview

This guide outlines the Principal Agent's key duties under the JBCC Principal Building Agreement (PBA). As Principal Agent, Donovan/Proman has specific contractual obligations that must be fulfilled impartially and professionally.

---

## Core Principle: Dual Role

The Principal Agent has a **dual role**:

1. **Agent of the Employer** - Administering the contract on behalf of the client
2. **Independent Certifier** - Making fair and impartial decisions on technical/contractual matters

**Critical:** When certifying payments, extensions of time, or completion, the PA must act **fairly and impartially** between Employer and Contractor, even though appointed by the Employer.

| Issue instructions in writing | 6.3 | As required | PA Instructions (PAIs) |
| Approve contractor's program | 6.4 | Within 14 days of submission | Approved construction program |
| Monitor progress against program | 6.4 | Ongoing | Progress reports |

---

### 2. Quality Control & Inspections

| Duty | JBCC Clause | Timing | Deliverable |
|------|-------------|--------|-------------|
| Inspect works for compliance | 6.16 | Regular site visits | Inspection reports |
| Reject non-conforming work | 6.16 | Immediately upon discovery | Rejection notice |

| Conduct practical completion inspection | 6.27 | When contractor notifies readiness | Snag list |
| Conduct final completion inspection | 6.28 | After defects liability period | Final snag list |

---

### 3. Time Management (Extensions of Time)

| Duty | JBCC Clause | Timing | Deliverable |
|------|-------------|--------|-------------|
| Receive EOT notice from Contractor | 6.13.1 | Within 10 working days of delay event | Logged notice |
| Request further information if needed | 6.13.2 | Within 5 working days | Information request |
| Assess EOT claim | 6.13.3 | Within 10 working days of receiving info | EOT determination |
| Grant or refuse EOT | 6.13.3 | Per timelines above | Written determination with reasons |
| Assess concurrent delays | 6.13 | During EOT assessment | Fair apportionment |
| Revise completion date | 6.13.4 | After granting EOT | Updated project program |

**Key Principle:** PA must act fairly when assessing delays, even if caused by Employer. Failure to grant valid EOT exposes Employer to "time at large" risk.

---

### 4. Cost Management & Variations

| Duty | JBCC Clause | Timing | Deliverable |
|------|-------------|--------|-------------|
| Issue variation instructions | 6.19.1 | As required | Variation Order (VO) |
| Assess cost impact of variations | 6.19 | Before/after issuing VO | Cost estimate |
| Approve Contractor's variation quotation | 6.19.3 | Within reasonable time | Approved/rejected quotation |
| Value variations if no agreement | 6.19.4 | Per valuation rules | Fair valuation |
| Monitor cumulative variation impact | 6.19 | Ongoing | Budget reports |

---

### 5. Payment Certification

| Duty | JBCC Clause | Timing | Deliverable |
|------|-------------|--------|-------------|
| Receive Contractor's payment claim | 6.25.1 | Monthly (or per contract) | Payment application |
| Verify work completed | 6.25.2 | Within 10 working days | Site verification |
| Issue Payment Certificate | 6.25.3 | Within 10 working days of claim | Payment Certificate |
| Certify retention release | 6.25.4 | At practical/final completion | Retention certificate |
| Issue Final Payment Certificate | 6.28.4 | After final completion | Final account |

**Key Principle:** PA must certify amounts **fairly and accurately**. Cannot withhold payment to Contractor for Employer's convenience. Certified amounts create legal obligation for Employer to pay.

---

### 6. Completion Certification

| Duty | JBCC Clause | Timing | Deliverable |
|------|-------------|--------|-------------|
| Inspect for Practical Completion | 6.27.1 | When Contractor gives notice | Site inspection |
| Issue Practical Completion Certificate | 6.27.2 | If works substantially complete | PC Certificate + snag list |
| Monitor defects rectification | 6.27.3 | During defects liability period | Defects tracking |
| Inspect for Final Completion | 6.28.1 | After DLP and snags complete | Final inspection |
| Issue Final Completion Certificate | 6.28.2 | If all works complete | FC Certificate |

**Practical Completion Standard:** Works must be "practically complete" (not 100% perfect). Minor defects do not prevent PC if building is usable. Use snag list for minor items.

---

### 7. Dispute Resolution

| Duty | JBCC Clause | Timing | Deliverable |
|------|-------------|--------|-------------|
| Issue determinations on disputes | 6.5 | Within reasonable time | Written determination |
| Facilitate adjudication process | 6.23 | If dispute escalates | Adjudication coordination |
| Provide documents to adjudicator | 6.23 | As required | Contract documents, correspondence |

## Principal Agent Authority & Limitations

### What PA CAN Do:
- Issue instructions for variations within scope of works
- Approve materials, subcontractors, programs
- Grant extensions of time
- Certify payments, practical completion, final completion
- Reject non-conforming work
- Resolve technical disputes

### What PA CANNOT Do (Requires Employer Approval):
- Change the scope of works fundamentally
- Instruct variations beyond authorized thresholds (if contract limits exist)
- Waive Employer's contractual rights
- Terminate the contract (Employer's decision)
- Negotiate contract amendments
- Release performance guarantees

**Always clarify authority limits with Employer at project inception.**

---

## Standard of Care

The Principal Agent owes a duty of care to the Employer to:
- Exercise reasonable skill and care expected of a competent PM professional
- Act in Employer's best interests (subject to duty of impartiality)
- Not negligently certify incorrect amounts
- Not negligently grant unwarranted EOTs
- Keep Employer informed of project status, risks, and issues

**Liability Risk:** PA can be sued by Employer for professional negligence if duties are performed carelessly. Maintain Professional Indemnity insurance.

---

## Documentation & Record-Keeping

**Essential records to maintain:**
- All PA Instructions (PAIs) - numbered and filed
- Site meeting minutes with action items
- Payment Certificates - numbered sequentially
- Extension of Time determinations - with full reasoning
- Variation Orders - with cost impacts
- Inspection reports and rejection notices
- Correspondence with Contractor and consultants
- Photographic records of works progress

**Purpose:** Protect both Employer and PA in case of disputes. Courts rely heavily on contemporaneous records.

## Red Flags & Risk Mitigation

### Red Flag 1: Contractor Claims Unwarranted EOT
**Risk:** Granting invalid EOT exposes Employer to cost overruns.
**Mitigation:** Thoroughly investigate delays, request supporting documentation, assess concurrent delays fairly, document reasoning.

### Red Flag 2: Pressure from Employer to Withhold Valid Payment
**Risk:** PA liability for unfair certification; Contractor may suspend works.
**Mitigation:** Explain duty of impartiality, certify fairly, document reasons if withholding is justified.

### Red Flag 3: Quality Issues Not Detected Early
**Risk:** Costly rework, disputes, defects after handover.
**Mitigation:** Conduct regular inspections, reject work immediately, involve consultants, document thoroughly.

### Red Flag 4: Poor Contractor Performance
**Risk:** Delays, cost overruns, disputes.
**Mitigation:** Issue early warning notices, document performance issues, escalate to Employer, consider termination if serious.

### Red Flag 5: Scope Creep via Informal Instructions
**Risk:** Contractor claims unpriced variations later.
**Mitigation:** All instructions in writing via formal PAIs, no verbal agreements, document site discussions.
