# JBCC Reference Library

## Overview

This folder contains reference materials for the **Joint Building Contracts Committee (JBCC)** framework, which governs most of Proman's construction project contracts where Donovan acts as **Principal Agent**.

## What is the JBCC?

The JBCC is a South African standard form building contract used widely in the construction industry. It defines the contractual relationships between:

- **Employer** (Client/Developer)
- **Principal Agent** (Project Manager - Proman's role)
- **Contractor** (Builder/Main Contractor)
- **Principal Consultant** (Architect or other lead design professional)
- **Quantity Surveyor**
- **Other Consultants**

## Proman's Role: Principal Agent

As Principal Agent under JBCC contracts, Proman has specific contractual duties including:

- **Contract Administration** - Issue instructions, variations, extensions of time
- **Certification** - Approve payments, practical completion, final completion
- **Quality Control** - Inspect works, reject non-conforming work
- **Time Management** - Assess delay claims, grant extensions of time
- **Cost Management** - Approve variations, assess cost impacts
- **Dispute Resolution** - Administer adjudication processes
- **Communication Hub** - Coordinate between Employer, Contractor, and consultants

## Folder Structure

### `/contract-framework/`
Contains JBCC contract documents, clause guides, and Principal Agent duty checklists:
- Principal Building Agreement (PBA) series
- Nominated/Selected Subcontract agreements
- Clause-by-clause guides
- Principal Agent duties matrix

### `/case-law/`

## Integration with PMP Framework

JBCC contracts align with PMI/PMP processes but use specific South African legal terminology:

| PMP Process | JBCC Equivalent |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Integrated Change Control | Variation Orders (Clause 6.19) |
| Schedule Control | Extensions of Time (Clause 6.13) |
| Cost Control | Payment Certificates (Clause 6.25) |
| Quality Control | Site Inspections & Rejection (Clause 6.16) |
| Procurement | Nominated Subcontracts (Clause 5.1) |
| Risk Management | Employer's Risk Events (Clause 6.18) |
| Stakeholder Management | Principal Agent coordination duties |

## Key JBCC Clauses for Principal Agents

**Critical duties to understand:**
- **Clause 6.3** - Principal Agent's authority and limitations
- **Clause 6.13** - Extension of Time procedures
- **Clause 6.16** - Inspection and rejection of work
- **Clause 6.19** - Variation procedures
- **Clause 6.25** - Payment certification
- **Clause 6.27** - Practical Completion certificate
- **Clause 6.28** - Final Completion certificate

## Using This Reference

When faced with JBCC-specific issues:

1. **Check contract clause** - Review specific clause in `/contract-framework/`
2. **Review case law** - Check if issue has been litigated in `/case-law/`
3. **Document decision** - Record rationale in project files
4. **Apply PMP principles** - Use PMP methodology within JBCC framework
5. **Consult legal** - Complex disputes require legal advice
