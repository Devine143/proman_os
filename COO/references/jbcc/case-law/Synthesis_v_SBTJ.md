# Synthesis Projects v SBTJ Properties

## Citation
High Court

## Court/Forum
High Court

## Date
Not specified (recent case)

## Parties
- **Plaintiff/Applicant:** Synthesis Projects (Contractor)
- **Defendant/Respondent:** SBTJ Properties (Employer)

## JBCC Clauses in Dispute
- Clause 6.25: Payment Certification
- Termination provisions
- Adjudication and enforcement

## Facts
The case involved disputes regarding **breaches of the JBCC contract** relating to payments and ultimately a termination.

**Timeline:**
1. Initial dispute arose over payment
2. Synthesis terminated the agreement
3. Negotiations resulted in a "second" agreement
4. Synthesis withdrew its cancellation letter
5. Further dispute arose regarding breaches, including payments
6. Contract was terminated again

The disputes were referred to **adjudication under the JBCC Adjudication Rules (October 2014)**.

**Synthesis's Claims:**
- Payment of unpaid certified payment certificates
- Monies not certified and not paid
- Payment for loss of profit

SBTJ did not oppose the relief and also submitted a counterclaim.

## Issues
1. Enforceability of adjudication determinations on payment certificates
2. Can terminated contracts be reinstated through negotiation?
3. What happens when a party gives notice of dissatisfaction but fails to pursue arbitration?

## Held
The adjudicator **found in favor of Synthesis**.

**Post-Adjudication:**
- SBTJ gave **notice of dissatisfaction**
- However, SBTJ **failed to take the required steps to pursue arbitration proceedings**
- Synthesis successfully applied to court under **Clause 6.2.2 of the JBCC contract** for enforcement of the adjudicator's decision

**Court ordered enforcement** of the full adjudication determination.

## Key Principles for Principal Agents
- **Payment certificates remain enforceable** even after contract termination
- **Adjudication determinations are enforceable** through court application (Clause 6.2.2)
- **Notice of dissatisfaction is not enough**—party must follow through with arbitration
- **Failure to pursue arbitration** after notice of dissatisfaction allows other party to enforce determination
- **Contract reinstatement through negotiation** is possible but must be clearly documented
- **Loss of profit claims** can be pursued through adjudication after wrongful termination

## Application to Proman Projects
**Key Takeaways:**

### 1. Payment Certificates After Termination
**Important:** Payment certificates issued before termination remain valid and enforceable even after the contract ends.

**If contract is terminated:**
- Previously certified amounts must still be paid
- Contractor can pursue payment through adjudication
- Termination does not void prior payment obligations

### 2. Notice of Dissatisfaction Requirements
**If a party issues notice of dissatisfaction with your PA determination or adjudication result:**

They must then:
1. Pursue arbitration proceedings
2. Follow procedural timelines strictly
3. Actually initiate the arbitration

**If they fail to pursue arbitration:**
- The determination becomes enforceable
- Other party can apply to court under Clause 6.2.2
- Issuing notice is not enough—must follow through

**Advising clients:**
- "You issued notice of dissatisfaction—now you MUST pursue arbitration within [X days per contract]"
- "If you do not pursue arbitration, the determination will be enforceable and the contractor can apply to court"
- "Issuing the notice is only step 1—you must follow through"

### 3. Contract Reinstatement
**Interesting aspect:** Synthesis initially terminated, but parties negotiated and withdrew the termination.

This shows:
- Terminations can be reversed by mutual agreement
- Important to document any reinstatement clearly in writing
- New agreement should clarify status of previous disputes

**If client wants to reverse a termination:**
- Document reinstatement clearly
- Address status of previous disputes/claims
- Consider whether fresh start or continuation of original contract
- Get legal advice on implications
