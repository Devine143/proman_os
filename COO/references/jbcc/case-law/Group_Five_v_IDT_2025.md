# Group Five Construction v IDT (2025)

## Citation
High Court (2025)

## Court/Forum
High Court

## Date
2025

## Parties
- **Plaintiff/Applicant:** Group Five Construction (Contractor)
- **Defendant/Respondent:** Independent Development Trust (IDT) (Employer)

## JBCC Clauses in Dispute
- Clause 34.10: Final Payment Certificate and payment timelines
- Clause 27: Defects Liability Period and rectification
- General payment and completion provisions

## Facts
Group Five was hired by the Independent Development Trust to build the **Mpumalanga High Court**. Upon project completion, the Principal Agent issued:
1. **Final Payment Certificate for R14.4 million**
2. **Final Completion Certificate** noting defects including:
   - Waterproofing issues
   - Possible structural cracks
   - Other defects to be addressed during the defects liability period

**IDT withheld payment**, arguing that:
- The defects made the works incomplete
- Payment was conditional on rectification of all defects
- The principle of reciprocity (payment for performance) allowed them to withhold payment

Group Five brought proceedings to enforce the Final Payment Certificate.

## Issues
1. Can an Employer withhold payment on a Final Payment Certificate due to outstanding defects?
2. Does the principle of reciprocity apply to JBCC payment obligations?
3. What is the relationship between payment certification and defect rectification under JBCC contracts?
4. Are Final Payment Certificates conditional on defect-free works?

## Held
The High Court **ruled in favor of Group Five** and **ordered IDT to pay** the full certified amount.

**Key Holdings:**
- Under **Clause 34.10 of the JBCC contract**, payment must be made **within 21 days** of certificate issuance
- **Defects are handled separately** under Clause 27 through a distinct remedial process
- Payment certificates are **binding and equivalent to cash** (reaffirming *Joob Joob Investments v Stocks Mavundla Zek Joint Venture* 2009 SCA)
- **The principle of reciprocity does NOT apply** because the JBCC contract structure **separates certification from defect rectification**
- Outstanding defects during the defects liability period **do not suspend the payment obligation**

**Court's Reasoning:**
The JBCC contract creates a specific framework where:
1. Practical/Final Completion Certificates are issued even with minor defects (snag list)
2. Payment is certified based on completed value
3. Defects are tracked and rectified under the defects liability provisions (Clause 27)
4. These are **separate, parallel processes**—not conditional on each other

## Key Principles for Principal Agents
- **Payment and defect rectification are separate processes** under JBCC
- **Defects do not prevent certification** of Practical or Final Completion
- **Defects do not suspend payment obligations**—Employers must pay certified amounts
- **Final Completion Certificate can be issued** even with defects noted on snag list
- **21-day payment period is absolute** from certificate issuance
- **Snag lists are the mechanism** for managing defects during defects liability period (DLP)
- **Principal Agents must issue certificates** even when defects exist—use snag lists to track remediation

## Application to Proman Projects
**Critical Guidance for Donovan as Principal Agent:**

### When Issuing Practical Completion Certificate:
1. **Do NOT withhold PC Certificate** due to minor defects
2. **Create comprehensive snag list** noting all defects
3. **Issue PC Certificate** with snag list attached
4. **Certify retention release** as per contract (typically 50% at PC)
5. **Start DLP clock** (usually 90 days to 12 months depending on contract)

### When Issuing Final Completion Certificate:
1. **Can issue FC Certificate** even if some defects remain
2. **Note outstanding defects** on the Final Completion Certificate
3. **These defects must be minor/non-critical**—building must be substantially complete and usable
4. **Track defect rectification separately** under Clause 27 process

### Managing Client Expectations:
**Common Client Objection:** "Why should I pay when there are still defects?"

**Your Response as PA:**
- "Under the JBCC contract, payment and defect rectification are separate processes"
- "The Final Payment Certificate creates an immediate legal obligation to pay within 21 days"
- "Outstanding defects are tracked on the snag list and contractor must rectify during DLP"
- "If contractor fails to rectify defects, you have remedies under Clause 27 including:
  - Engaging another contractor to fix at original contractor's cost
  - Claiming damages
  - Withholding final retention (if not yet released)"
- "But you cannot withhold the certified payment amount—courts have consistently ruled this is unlawful"

### Risk Mitigation:
- **Document all defects thoroughly** on snag lists with photos
- **Set clear rectification deadlines** for each defect item
- **Track defect rectification progress** systematically during DLP
- **Do not allow clients to withhold payment**—explain legal consequences (court enforcement)
- **Advise on retention strategy**—final retention should only be released after all critical defects rectified

### Practical Workflow:
**At Practical Completion:**
- Inspect works with contractor
- Create detailed snag list (minor defects)
- Issue PC Certificate + snag list
- Certify 50% retention release (if contract allows)
- Start DLP period

**During DLP:**
- Monitor defect rectification
- Update snag list as items are completed
- Conduct regular inspections

**At Final Completion:**
- Verify all (or substantially all) defects rectified
- Minor outstanding items can be noted on FC Certificate
- Issue Final Completion Certificate
- Certify final retention release (or withhold if critical defects remain)
- Issue Final Payment Certificate
