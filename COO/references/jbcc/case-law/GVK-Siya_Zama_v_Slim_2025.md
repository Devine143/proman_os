# GVK-Siya Zama v Slim B&D Construction (2025)

## Citation
High Court (2025)

## Court/Forum
High Court

## Date
2025

## Parties
- **Plaintiff/Applicant:** GVK-Siya Zama (Party seeking adjudication determination)
- **Defendant/Respondent:** Slim B&D Construction (Party attempting to delay adjudication)

## JBCC Clauses in Dispute
- Adjudication timelines and procedures
- Obligation of adjudicator to issue determination within contractual timeframes
- Referral to arbitration provisions

## Facts
A dispute was referred to adjudication under the JBCC Adjudication Rules. After submissions were filed by both parties, **Slim requested the adjudicator to hold back his determination**, citing an ongoing arbitration over jurisdiction.

**Slim threatened the adjudicator with a costs order** if he proceeded to issue the determination. The adjudicator initially agreed to wait.

**GVK brought an urgent counter-application** to compel the adjudicator to publish his determination on the specified contractual date, arguing that Slim's request was a delay tactic.

## Issues
1. Can a party delay an adjudicator's determination by citing a separate arbitration on jurisdiction?
2. What are the adjudicator's obligations regarding contractual timelines?
3. What remedies exist when a party attempts to obstruct the adjudication process?
4. Can parties threaten adjudicators to influence the process?

## Held
The court **dismissed Slim's arguments** and **ruled in favor of GVK**, ordering the adjudicator to issue the determination according to the contractual timeline.

**Key Holdings:**
- Slim's arguments were **purely a delaying tactic** seeking to obstruct access to relief
- The referral to arbitration **did not alter the timeframe** for the adjudicator to deliver his decision on the merits
- The adjudicator was **ordered to give his determination** in accordance with the contractual timeline
- **Punitive costs order** imposed on Slim for both applications

**Court's Strong Language:**
The court specifically noted that Slim had used **"a tactical manoeuvre to delay and obstruct the adjudication process rather than a legitimate legal argument"**, warranting the punitive costs order.

## Key Principles for Principal Agents
- **Adjudication timelines are strict and enforceable**—parties cannot delay determinations
- **Courts will not tolerate delay tactics** in adjudication processes
- **Parallel arbitration proceedings do not suspend adjudication timelines**
- **Adjudicators must comply with contractual deadlines** for issuing determinations
- **Threatening adjudicators is impermissible** and may result in punitive costs
- **Courts protect the integrity of the adjudication process** through punitive costs orders
- **"Pay now, argue later"** philosophy is strictly enforced

## Application to Proman Projects
**If Donovan is involved in a project where adjudication is initiated:**

### As Principal Agent - Providing Documentation:
1. **Respond promptly** to adjudicator's requests for documents
2. **Maintain strict timelines**—adjudication is time-sensitive
3. **Provide complete contract documents, correspondence, and certificates**
4. **Do not delay or obstruct** the adjudication process
5. **Cooperate fully** even if the determination may go against your client

### Advising Clients During Adjudication:
**Common Client Request:** "Can we delay the adjudication until we gather more evidence / consult lawyers / start arbitration?"

**Your Response:**
- "No—adjudication timelines are strict and courts enforce them rigorously"
- "Attempting to delay the adjudication can result in punitive costs orders"
- "The case of GVK-Siya Zama shows courts have zero tolerance for delay tactics"
- "We must comply with all submission deadlines and cooperate with the adjudicator"
- "If you disagree with the determination, you can issue a notice of dissatisfaction within 10 days and pursue arbitration"
- "But the determination will still be immediately binding and you must comply while arbitration proceeds"

### Red Flags to Avoid:
- ❌ **Threatening the adjudicator** (may result in punitive costs)
- ❌ **Requesting delays** without legitimate grounds
- ❌ **Using parallel proceedings** (arbitration/litigation) as excuse to delay adjudication
- ❌ **Missing submission deadlines** intentionally
- ❌ **Failing to provide requested documents**

### Risk Mitigation:
- **Calendar all adjudication deadlines** immediately upon referral
- **Prepare submissions well in advance** of deadlines
- **Gather all relevant documentation** proactively
- **Engage legal counsel early** if adjudication is likely
- **Advise clients about costs consequences** of obstruction

### Timeline Management:
Standard JBCC adjudication timeline:
- **Referral notice** → Adjudicator appointment
- **7-14 days** → Parties submit statements and documents
- **7-14 days** → Adjudicator reviews and may request further information
- **28-42 days from referral** → Adjudicator issues determination
- **10 working days** → Notice of dissatisfaction deadline (if party disagrees)

**Do NOT attempt to extend these timelines without adjudicator agreement and legitimate grounds.**
