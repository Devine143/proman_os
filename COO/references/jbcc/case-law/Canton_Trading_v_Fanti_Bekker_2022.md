# Canton Trading v Fanti Bekker Hattingh NO (Trust) (2022)

## Citation
Supreme Court of Appeal (2022)

## Court/Forum
Supreme Court of Appeal

## Date
2022

## Parties
- **Plaintiff/Applicant:** Canton Trading (Principal Agent)
- **Defendant/Respondent:** Fanti Bekker Hattingh NO (Trust) (Employer)

## JBCC Clauses in Dispute
- Arbitration clause validity
- Whether arbitration agreement exists
- Jurisdiction to determine arbitration agreement existence

## Facts
Canton Trading acted as **Principal Agent** for a Trust under a **JBCC Series 2000 Standard Building Agreement** with a building contractor.

When the JBCC agreement was **terminated in August 2014** due to defective work by the contractor, the Trust alleged Canton had **failed to perform its duties as principal agent**.

The Trust sought to compel Canton to arbitration based on an **unsigned "Appointment of Professional Service Provider" (PSP)** document that contained an arbitration clause referring to AFSA Rules.

**Key Dispute:**
- Canton **denied that the PSP agreement existed** (unsigned document)
- Canton refused to submit to arbitration
- Trust applied to court to compel arbitration

**Lower Court Holdings:**
- High Court: Found valid arbitration agreement exists, ordered Canton to arbitration
- Full Bench: Affirmed, finding arbitrator has jurisdiction to rule on existence of arbitration agreement under AFSA Rules

## Issues
1. When there is a dispute over whether an arbitration agreement exists, who decides—court or arbitrator?
2. Does the separability doctrine apply to challenges about the existence of the arbitration agreement itself?
3. What is the "robust approach" and when does it apply?
4. Can an arbitrator determine his own jurisdiction when the arbitration agreement's existence is challenged?

## Held
The Supreme Court of Appeal **reversed** the lower courts and found that **the court, not the arbitrator**, must decide whether the arbitration agreement exists.

**Key Holdings:**
- The **very existence** of the PSP agreement and its arbitration clause was being challenged
- There was a **real dispute of fact** as to whether the parties concluded the PSP agreement
- The "robust approach" does **not apply** when there is a genuine dispute about contract existence
- The **separability doctrine** does not apply when there is a **direct challenge to the validity or existence of the arbitration agreement itself**
- Canton's evidence was not perfunctory—there was a genuine dispute requiring oral evidence
- Referral to arbitration under AFSA Rules would only be warranted if a separate arbitration agreement had been concluded to submit this specific dispute to arbitration

**Court vs. Arbitrator Jurisdiction:**
The SCA clarified that:
- Courts determine whether an arbitration agreement **exists** in the first place
- Arbitrators determine their jurisdiction **once the existence of an arbitration agreement is established**
- When existence itself is disputed, courts must resolve this threshold issue

## Key Principles for Principal Agents
- **Arbitration agreements must be clearly established** before disputes can be referred
- **Unsigned documents** may not create binding arbitration obligations
- When **existence of arbitration agreement is disputed**, courts decide, not arbitrators
- **Separability doctrine has limits**—does not protect arbitration clauses from existence challenges
- **PA service agreements should be signed** and clear to avoid these disputes
- **Document all appointments formally** with signed agreements

## Quotes
> "The very agreement to submit the dispute to arbitration was being challenged."

> "The separability doctrine does not apply when there is a direct challenge to the validity or existence of the arbitration agreement itself."

> "The court, not the arbitrator, must decide the existence dispute."

## Application to Proman Projects
**Critical Lessons for Proman's PA Appointments:**

### 1. PA Appointment Documentation
**Always ensure:**
- [ ] PA appointment letter/agreement is **signed** by both parties (Proman and Employer)
- [ ] Scope of services clearly defined
- [ ] Fee structure documented
- [ ] Dispute resolution mechanism clearly stated
- [ ] **Do not rely on unsigned drafts**—this case shows they may not be enforceable

### 2. Arbitration Clauses in PA Agreements
**If Proman's PA agreements include arbitration clauses:**
- Ensure the **entire agreement is signed**
- Cannot enforce arbitration based on unsigned documents
- If dispute arises about whether you even had a PA agreement, court will decide threshold issue
- Only after existence is confirmed can disputes be referred to arbitration

### 3. JBCC Contract vs. PA Appointment
**Understand the distinction:**
- **JBCC contract**: Between Employer and Contractor (you administer as PA)
- **PA appointment**: Between Employer and Proman (your service agreement)

**This case involved the PA appointment, not the JBCC contract itself.**

If dispute arises with your client (Employer) about your PA duties:
- Check if your PA appointment agreement is signed
- Check if it has an arbitration clause
- If unsigned, you may not be able to compel arbitration
- Court proceedings may be necessary

### 4. Risk Mitigation
**To avoid Canton Trading scenario:**

**Before starting PA services:**
1. Draft PA appointment letter/agreement
2. Include clear arbitration clause (if desired)
3. **Get it signed** by both parties before commencing work
4. Keep signed original in project file

**During project:**
- If client disputes your PA duties, first check: "Is our PA agreement signed and valid?"
- If agreement validity is in question, court proceedings likely required (not arbitration)

**Template PA Appointment Clause:**
```
"This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of South Africa. Any dispute arising from this Agreement shall be referred to arbitration in accordance with the AFSA Rules / Arbitration Act [specify]. The arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding."
```
**Ensure this clause is in a SIGNED document.**

### 5. Distinguishing PA Liability from Contract Administration
**Canton Trading was sued for:**
- Breach of PA professional duties (allegedly failing to reject defective work)
- This is a claim against the PA's professional services
- Different from JBCC contract disputes (between Employer and Contractor)

**PA Professional Indemnity Insurance:**
- Ensure PI insurance covers claims like Canton Trading
- Claims alleging professional negligence in PA duties
- These can be substantial (project value or cost of rectification)
