# Joob Joob Investments v Stocks Mavundla Zek Joint Venture (2009)

## Citation
Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) (2009)

## Court/Forum
Supreme Court of Appeal

## Date
2009

## Parties
- **Plaintiff/Applicant:** Joob Joob Investments (Party seeking payment)
- **Defendant/Respondent:** Stocks Mavundla Zek Joint Venture (Party resisting payment)

## JBCC Clauses in Dispute
- Payment certification provisions
- Legal status of payment certificates under construction contracts

## Facts
This was a dispute over payment under a construction contract. The critical question was the legal status and enforceability of payment certificates issued under the contract.

The case involved interpretation of payment certificate provisions and whether certified amounts create immediate payment obligations.

## Issues
1. What is the legal status of payment certificates under construction contracts?
2. Are payment certificates liquid and enforceable?
3. How quickly must certified amounts be paid?
4. What is the nature of the payment obligation created by certification?

## Held
The Supreme Court of Appeal issued the **landmark ruling** that established the fundamental principle governing all subsequent payment certificate cases.

**The Critical Holding:**
**Payment certificates are "binding and equivalent to cash"**

This means:
- Certificates create **liquid and enforceable debts**
- Payment obligations are **immediate** (subject to contractual payment terms, typically 21 days)
- Certificates are treated as **acknowledgments of debt**
- Employers cannot withhold payment without very limited grounds (fraud)

This principle has been applied and reaffirmed in every subsequent JBCC payment dispute.

## Key Principles for Principal Agents
- **Payment certificates = cash** - this is the foundational principle
- **Liquid debt** created upon certificate issuance
- **Immediate enforceability** - contractors can pursue payment through courts
- **Very limited defenses** available to Employers
- **Foundation case** for all subsequent payment certificate jurisprudence in South Africa
- **Applies to all construction contracts**, not just JBCC

## Quotes

## Application to Proman Projects
**The Foundational Principle:**

When you issue a payment certificate as Principal Agent, you are creating the **equivalent of cash** for the contractor.

### Understanding "Equivalent to Cash"
This means:
1. **Liquid Debt:** As enforceable as if Employer signed a promissory note
2. **Immediate Obligation:** Payment due per contract terms (usually 21 days)
3. **Minimal Defenses:** Employer cannot simply refuse to pay
4. **Court Enforcement:** Contractor can obtain summary judgment on unpaid certificates

### Practical Implications for PA
**Before you certify:**
- Understand the gravity: you're creating a cash-equivalent obligation
- Verify amounts meticulously
- Ensure works are actually complete
- Document your verification thoroughly

**After you certify:**
- Certificate cannot easily be reversed
- Employer is legally bound to pay
- Your professional reputation depends on accuracy

### Advising Clients
**When issuing certificate:**
"I'm issuing a payment certificate for R[X]. Under South African law (Joob Joob case), this creates an obligation equivalent to cash. You must pay within 21 days. The only grounds to dispute payment are fraud or manifest error—disagreement over valuation is not sufficient."

**When client objects to paying:**
"The Supreme Court has ruled that payment certificates are equivalent to cash. You cannot withhold payment based on disagreement. Your remedy, if the certificate is incorrect, is to pursue a claim against me as PA or the QS—but you must still pay the contractor."

### Professional Standard
**Joob Joob establishes the professional standard:**
- PAs must exercise utmost care in certification
- Errors can result in significant client liability
- Professional indemnity insurance is essential
- Certification is a serious professional responsibility, not an administrative task

### Hierarchy of Enforceability
**Legal enforceability (strongest to weakest):**
1. **Cash / Bank transfer** - immediate value
2. **Payment certificates** - "equivalent to cash" per Joob Joob ← You issue these
3. **Invoices** - less enforceable, can be disputed more easily
4. **Quotes / estimates** - not binding payment obligations

**Your role:** You elevate contractor's claims from mere invoices to cash-equivalent obligations through certification.
