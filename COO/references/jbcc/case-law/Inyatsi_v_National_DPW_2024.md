# Inyatsi Construction v National Department of Public Works (2024)

## Citation
High Court (2024)

## Court/Forum
High Court

## Date
2024

## Parties
- **Plaintiff/Applicant:** Inyatsi Construction (Contractor - Joint Venture Partner)
- **Defendant/Respondent:** National Department of Public Works (Employer)

## JBCC Clauses in Dispute
- Clause 6.25: Payment Certification
- Final Payment Certificate provisions
- Default interest provisions

## Facts
Inyatsi, as part of a joint venture, was awarded a tender to upgrade the Nelson Mandela Museum under a JBCC Principal Building Agreement Edition 4.1. After completing the project, the Principal Agent issued a **Final Payment Certificate on 9 January 2018 for R5,982,785.19**, with payment due within 21 days.

Despite repeated demands, the Department failed to pay. Inyatsi brought legal proceedings to enforce the Final Payment Certificate.

## Issues
1. Whether a Final Payment Certificate creates an enforceable payment obligation
2. Whether the Department could refuse payment despite the certificate
3. What legal status does a Final Payment Certificate have under JBCC contracts
4. Whether the Department is bound by the Principal Agent's certification

## Held
The court **ruled decisively in favor of Inyatsi**, ordering the Department to pay the full certified amount plus interest and costs.

Key findings:
- The Department **appointed the Principal Agent** to act on its behalf
- The Department **bound itself through agency** to perform contractual obligations and make payments upon certificate issuance
- The Final Payment Certificate constituted a **liquid acknowledgment of debt**
- The certificate created an **enforceable payment obligation**
- The Department was ordered to pay:
  - **R5,982,785.19** (certified amount)
  - **Contractual default interest** as determined by the Minister of Finance
  - **Costs** of the application

## Key Principles for Principal Agents
- **Final Payment Certificates are liquid documents** equivalent to acknowledgments of debt
- **Immediate payment obligation** arises upon certificate issuance (21 days under JBCC)
- **Employers are bound by PA's certification**, having appointed the PA as their agent
- **State entities cannot avoid payment** despite being the Employer
- **Default interest provisions are enforceable** from the JBCC contract
- **Principal Agents create legal obligations** for Employers when they certify—exercise care and accuracy

## Quotes
> "The Department appointed the Principal Agent to act on its behalf and bound itself through the agency to perform contractual obligations and make payments upon the issue of certificates."

> "The Final Payment Certificate constituted a liquid acknowledgment of debt that created an enforceable payment obligation."

## Application to Proman Projects
**Critical Implications for Donovan as Principal Agent:**

1. **PA Liability Awareness:** When you issue a Final Payment Certificate (or interim certificate), you are creating a **binding legal obligation** for your client (the Employer) to pay

2. **Verification is Critical:** Before certifying, thoroughly verify the amounts are accurate and justified—your certificate creates a liquid debt

3. **Client Communication:** Inform clients BEFORE issuing certificates what amounts will be certified and when payment is due (21 days)

4. **Cannot Reverse Certificates Easily:** Once issued, certificates are enforceable—cannot be withdrawn without contractor agreement

5. **State/Municipal Clients:** Even government entities cannot avoid payment based on certificates you issue

**Risk Mitigation for Proman:**
- Maintain rigorous verification processes before certification
- Document all verification activities (site inspections, QS valuations)
- Ensure clients understand their payment obligations when appointing you as PA
- Professional Indemnity insurance must cover potential negligent certification claims

**Operational Workflow:**
- Before issuing Final Payment Certificate:
  - Verify all works complete (or defects on snag list)
  - Confirm QS final account
  - Obtain client sign-off on final account where possible
  - Issue certificate and immediately notify client of 21-day payment deadline
