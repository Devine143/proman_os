# Pro-Khaya Construction CC v City of Cape Town (2025)

## Citation
High Court Western Cape (2025)

## Court/Forum
High Court Western Cape

## Date
2025

## Parties
- **Plaintiff/Applicant:** Pro-Khaya Construction CC (Contractor)
- **Defendant/Respondent:** City of Cape Town (Employer)

## JBCC Clauses in Dispute
- Clause 30.6.3: Binding nature of adjudicator's determination
- Clause 6.13: Extensions of Time (EOT)
- General adjudication provisions

## Facts
Pro-Khaya was appointed by the City of Cape Town in 2018 to construct an electrical depot in Hout Bay under a JBCC Principal Building Agreement, Edition 6.1. Disputes arose over delays, extensions of time (EOTs), and termination of the contract. After referring the matter to adjudication, the adjudicator issued a determination in Pro-Khaya's favor, awarding the contractor millions of rand.

The City refused to comply with the determination and sought to have it reviewed, arguing the adjudicator lacked jurisdiction and acted unreasonably. Critically, the City failed to issue a notice of dissatisfaction within the contractual 10-day period.

## Issues
1. Whether the adjudicator's determination was immediately binding and enforceable
2. Whether the adjudicator had jurisdiction to make the determination
3. What grounds exist for courts to review adjudication determinations under JBCC contracts
4. Whether the City's failure to issue a timely notice of dissatisfaction affected the finality of the determination

## Held
The High Court Western Cape **dismissed the City's review application** and **ordered enforcement of the determination**.

The court ruled that:
- Adjudicators under JBCC contracts act as **experts, not arbitrators**
- The **Arbitration Act does not apply** to JBCC adjudications
- The determination is **immediately binding** and must be implemented by the parties under clause 30.6.3
- The City's **failure to issue a notice of dissatisfaction within 10 days** rendered the determination **final and enforceable**
- Review proceedings are permissible only in cases of **fraud, collusion, capriciousness, or manifestly unjust determination**—none of which were present

## Key Principles for Principal Agents
- **Adjudication determinations are immediately binding** even when parties disagree
- **Strict 10-day deadline** for issuing notice of dissatisfaction—failure renders determination final
- Adjudicators act as **experts with wide discretion**, not arbitrators
- Courts take a **pro-enforcement stance** on adjudication
- **Very limited grounds for review**: fraud, collusion, capriciousness, or manifest injustice only
- **Principal Agents must be aware** that their certification decisions and EOT assessments may be subject to adjudication with binding consequences

## Quotes
> "Adjudicators under JBCC contracts act as experts, not arbitrators, meaning the Arbitration Act does not apply."

> "The determination is immediately binding and must be implemented by the parties under clause 30.6.3 of the JBCC contract."

## Application to Proman Projects
**Critical Implications:**
1. When issuing EOT determinations or payment certificates as PA, be aware these decisions can be challenged via adjudication
2. If adjudication occurs on a Proman project, ensure the Employer (client) understands the 10-day notice requirement
3. Advise clients that adjudication determinations are immediately enforceable even if they disagree
4. Document all EOT and payment decisions thoroughly to defend against potential adjudication challenges
5. Review is not readily available—parties must comply first, challenge later

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Maintain detailed contemporaneous records of all PA decisions
- Ensure all EOT assessments include clear reasoning
- Advise Employers immediately when adjudication is initiated
- Explain the binding nature and limited review grounds to clients
