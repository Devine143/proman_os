## Citation
High Court (2021)

## Court/Forum
High Court

## Date
2021

## Parties
- **Plaintiff/Applicant:** Zingwazi Contractors (Contractor)
- **Defendant/Respondent:** Eastern Cape Department of Human Settlements (Employer/State Entity)

## JBCC Clauses in Dispute
- JBCC Adjudication Rules
- Enforceability of adjudication determinations against state entities

## Facts
A dispute was referred to adjudication under the JBCC Adjudication Rules. The adjudicator issued a determination in favor of Zingwazi for **R12 million**.

The Department of Human Settlements refused to pay the determined amount and **challenged the constitutionality of JBCC adjudication rules**, arguing that:
- Adjudication is contrary to public policy
- State entities should not be bound by private adjudication processes
- The adjudication rules violate constitutional principles

## Issues
1. Is JBCC adjudication constitutional?
2. Can state entities challenge adjudication on public policy grounds?
3. What harm would result from invalidating adjudication?
4. Are adjudication rules fair to both parties?

## Held
The court **dismissed the constitutional challenge** and **upheld the enforceability** of the adjudication determination.

**Key Holdings:**
- Adjudication is **NOT contrary to public policy**
- Adjudication provides **interim protection to both parties' interests**
- **Serious harm would follow** if parties were deprived of the option to agree to dispute resolution through adjudication
- **Works might be suspended** until disputes are resolved, causing **severe financial implications**
- State entities **are bound** by adjudication determinations when they enter JBCC contracts
- The Department was **ordered to pay the R12 million** determination

## Key Principles for Principal Agents
- **Adjudication is constitutional** and enforceable
- **State entities cannot avoid adjudication** on public policy grounds
- **Constitutional challenges will fail** - adjudication framework is sound
- **Project continuity protected** - adjudication prevents work suspensions during disputes
- **Both parties benefit** from interim adjudication process
- **Provincial/municipal clients** are bound by adjudication determinations

## Quotes
> "Adjudication is not contrary to public policy and provides interim protection to both parties' interests."

## Application to Proman Projects
**When Working with State/Municipal Clients:**

Many of Proman's clients may be state entities, municipalities, or public institutions. This case confirms that:

1. **State clients are fully bound** by JBCC adjudication provisions
2. **Cannot claim immunity** or special treatment due to public entity status
3. **Must pay adjudication determinations** even if they are government departments
4. **Constitutional challenges will fail** - this has been definitively settled

**Advising State Clients:**
- "As a state entity, you are bound by the JBCC adjudication provisions"
- "You cannot avoid adjudication determinations on public policy or constitutional grounds"
- "This has been tested and confirmed by the courts in Zingwazi (2021)"
- "If you enter a JBCC contract, you must comply with adjudication determinations"
