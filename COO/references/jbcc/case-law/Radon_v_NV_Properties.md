# Radon Projects v NV Properties

## Citation
Grahamstown High Court; Supreme Court of Appeal

## Court/Forum
Grahamstown High Court (initial); Supreme Court of Appeal (on appeal)

## Date
Not specified (older JBCC case - likely pre-2010 based on contract edition)

## Parties
- **Plaintiff/Applicant:** Radon Projects (Contractor)
- **Defendant/Respondent:** NV Properties (Employer)

## JBCC Clauses in Dispute
- Clause 29.1: Extension of Time claims (1998 Edition)
- Clause 40: Dispute determination and challenge procedures (1998 Edition)
- Notice requirements for challenging PA decisions

## Facts
Radon was employed by NV Properties under a **JBCC Principal Building Agreement (May 1998 Edition)** for the **Alberton Police Station project**.

**Prior to practical completion**, the contractor submitted **numerous extension of time (EOT) claims** under Clause 29.1. The Principal Agent either:
- Failed to adjudicate the claims, or
- Rejected the claims

**Critical Procedural Issue:**
- **Clause 40 (1998 edition)** provides that disagreements must be determined by the Principal Agent **within 10 working days** of a request
- Such decisions are **final and binding** unless a **dispute notice is given within 20 working days**
- **The contractor FAILED to give the required notice** to challenge the Principal Agent's decisions in terms of Clause 40

**Employer's Defense:**
The Employer argued that:
- The Principal Agent's decisions were therefore **final and binding**
- There was no arbitral **"dispute"** between the parties since the decisions were unchallenged
- The contractor was time-barred from pursuing the EOT claims

**High Court Decision:**
The High Court agreed with the Employer, finding that:
- The contractor's **failure to follow the claims procedure** rendered those initial claims **final and binding**
- No arbitrable dispute existed

## Issues
1. What happens when a contractor fails to challenge a PA's decision within the contractual notice period?
2. Are unchallenged PA decisions final and binding even if incorrect?
3. Can a contractor revive time-barred claims later with new information?
4. What is the difference between initial claims and revised post-completion claims?

## Held
**High Court:** Found in favor of Employer—initial EOT claims were time-barred and final.

**Supreme Court of Appeal (on appeal):** Partially reversed, with important clarifications.

**SCA Key Holdings:**
1. **Initial EOT claims were time-barred** due to contractor's failure to issue dispute notice within 20 working days
2. **However**, the contractor was **entitled to revise and update its earlier claims** in light of **information that came to hand after completion of the works**
3. The Principal Agent was **obliged to consider these revised claims**
4. The SCA distinguished between:
   - **Time-barred initial claims** - no dispute exists (final and binding)
   - **New/revised claims based on new information** - these could properly be arbitrated

**Critical Distinction:**
- Original EOT claims submitted during construction and not challenged = time-barred and final
- Revised EOT claims submitted after practical completion based on new information = valid and arbitrable

## Key Principles for Principal Agents
- **Strict procedural compliance is essential** under JBCC contracts
- **Time bars are rigorously enforced**—failure to issue dispute notice within 20 working days renders PA decisions final
- **PA decisions become final and binding** if not challenged within the contractual timeframe
- **However**, contractors can **revise and update claims** with new information that comes to light post-completion
- **PA must consider revised claims** based on new information—cannot rely on time bar of initial claims
- **"New information" is the key**—revised claims must be based on facts not known at time of initial claim
- **Procedural fairness**—while time bars are enforced, the system allows for post-completion claim updates when justified

## Application to Proman Projects
**Critical Procedural Guidance for Donovan as Principal Agent:**

### 1. When You Issue EOT Determinations
**You must:**
- Issue determination **within 10 working days** of receiving sufficient information (check your contract edition)
- Provide determination **in writing**
- Include **clear reasoning** for granting or refusing EOT
- **Notify both Employer and Contractor** of your determination

**After issuing determination:**
- **Calendar the 20-working-day deadline** from your determination
- **Monitor whether contractor issues dispute notice**
- **If no dispute notice within 20 working days** → determination becomes **final and binding**
- **Advise Employer** that determination is now final (cannot be challenged)

### 2. When Contractor Submits EOT Claims
**Track deadlines rigorously:**
- Log date of contractor's EOT notice
- Request further information if needed (within 5 working days typically)
- Calendar your 10-working-day determination deadline
- **Issue determination on time**—delays can prejudice Employer

**If contractor fails to challenge your determination:**
- After 20 working days, determination is final
- Contractor cannot later arbitrate that specific claim (unless revised with new info)

### 3. Managing Revised/Updated Claims Post-Completion
**If contractor submits "revised" EOT claim after PC:**

**You must assess:**
- Is this truly a **new claim based on new information**?
- Or is it a **re-argument of the original time-barred claim**?

**New information examples (likely valid revised claims):**
- As-built records showing actual delay durations unknown during construction
- Final account information revealing cost/time impacts not previously quantified
- Discovery of design errors post-completion that explain delays
- Weather data compiled post-completion showing cumulative delay impact

**Re-argument examples (likely time-barred):**
- Same facts as original claim, just presented differently
- "We miscalculated the delay days in our original claim"
- Trying to revive a claim that was rejected and not disputed within 20 days

**Your obligation:**
- **Must consider** revised claims based on genuinely new information
- **Can reject** revised claims that are merely re-arguments of time-barred claims
- **Document reasoning** clearly
- **Explain distinction** to both Employer and Contractor

### 4. Advising Employers on Time Bars
**Common Employer question:** "The contractor never challenged your EOT determination—can they still pursue this later?"

**Your response:**
- "Under Clause 40, they had 20 working days to issue a dispute notice"
- "They did not issue a notice, so my determination is now final and binding"
- "However, if the contractor later obtains new information (e.g., from as-built records), they may submit a revised claim"
- "A revised claim based on new information must be considered on its merits"
- "We cannot simply say 'time-barred'—we must assess whether it's genuinely new information or just a re-argument"

### 5. Advising Contractors (if they ask your view)
**If contractor asks:** "I missed the 20-day dispute deadline—can I still challenge your EOT determination?"

**Your response:**
- "The 20-day deadline has passed, so that specific determination is now final and binding"
- "You cannot challenge it through arbitration as originally framed"
- "However, if you have new information that has come to light since my determination—information you did not have access to at the time—you may submit a revised claim"
- "The revised claim must be based on genuinely new facts or evidence, not just a re-presentation of the original claim"
- "I am obliged to consider revised claims fairly if based on new information"

### 6. Best Practices for PA
**Protect yourself and your clients:**
- [ ] **Issue all determinations in writing** with clear reasons
- [ ] **Track all procedural deadlines** rigorously (10-day determination, 20-day dispute notice)
- [ ] **Notify parties explicitly** when determinations become final (after 20 days)
- [ ] **Maintain detailed records** of all claims, determinations, and notices
- [ ] **When assessing revised claims**, document your analysis of whether it's "new information" vs. "re-argument"
- [ ] **Advise Employers proactively** about time bar consequences
- [ ] **Do not ignore revised claims**—assess them fairly even if initial claim was time-barred

### 7. Sample Timeline (Based on JBCC Clause 40-type provisions)

**Day 0:** Contractor submits EOT claim
**Day 1-5:** PA requests further information (if needed)
**Day 5-10:** Contractor provides information
**Day 10:** PA issues written determination (grant or refuse EOT)
**Day 11-30:** 20-working-day period for contractor to issue dispute notice
**Day 31+:** If no dispute notice → determination is **final and binding**

**Months/years later:** Contractor submits revised claim based on new information
**PA obligation:** Must consider revised claim fairly (cannot simply rely on original time bar)
