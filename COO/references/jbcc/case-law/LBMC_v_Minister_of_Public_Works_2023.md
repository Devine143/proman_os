# LBMC Consulting v Minister of Public Works (2023)

## Citation
High Court (2023)

## Court/Forum
High Court

## Date
2023

## Parties
- **Plaintiff/Applicant:** LBMC Consulting (Contractor)
- **Defendant/Respondent:** Minister of Public Works and Second Defendant (Employer/Department)

## JBCC Clauses in Dispute
- Clause 6.19: Variations
- General contract termination provisions
- Contractor's rights when contract documents are defective

## Facts
LBMC was awarded a JBCC contract for completion of work at the **Alberton Police Station**. After commencing work, the contractor discovered a **massive discrepancy between the Bill of Quantities (BOQ)** furnished by the second defendant **and the work actually required**.

**Critical Document Defects Discovered:**
1. **BOQ did not match the actual project** - contractor asserted the BOQ "does not appear to have been specifically meant for this project"
2. **Drawings were for a different project** - "appear to have been for any other project and not for Alberton Police Station"
3. **Contract documents were "fatally flawed"**
4. **Undisclosed asbestos** requiring specialized removal - estimated **R20 million variation** beyond the flawed BOQ
5. **R6 million spent on improvements** for which contractor had not been paid

The contractor sent correspondence in **August 2019** seeking to adjust the contract price, highlighting the fundamental document flaws.

**Employer's Response:**
- The second defendant **placed the contractor in mora** (notice of breach)
- Afforded **five days to resume work**
- Contractor did not resume work
- Second defendant **cancelled the contract in January 2020**

**Post-Termination Admission:**
After termination, the second defendant's representative **conceded they had prematurely terminated the agreement and apologized**, stating he would not have terminated had the full facts been placed before him.

## Issues
1. Can a contractor suspend work when contract documents are fundamentally flawed?
2. Are variations required to correct defective BOQs and undisclosed site conditions?
3. Was the termination lawful given the document defects?
4. What damages can a contractor claim for wrongful termination?
5. Can variation claims be disguised as "contractor negligence"?

## Held
The court **found in favor of the contractor** on the key issues.

**Key Findings:**
- The contractor's **variation claims were required and necessary** to complete the project according to the defendant's requirements
- Variations **could not be disguised as negligence** by the contractor
- The contractor was **entitled to the variation occasioned by**:
  - Incorrect BOQ
  - Failure to disclose asbestos
- The **termination was premature** (as conceded by the defendant's representative)

**Contractor's Claims:**
- **R6 million** in damages for improvements made
- **R24 million** in variation claims exceeding 20% of the original contract price
- **Standing time costs**

## Key Principles for Principal Agents
- **Material errors in contract documents can justify contractor suspension** or variation claims
- **BOQs must accurately reflect the actual scope of work**—fundamental flaws entitle contractor to variations
- **Employers cannot terminate contracts** without addressing fundamental document defects that make performance impossible or fundamentally different
- **Variations are not "contractor negligence"** when caused by defective contract documents
- **Undisclosed site conditions** (like asbestos) trigger mandatory variation entitlements
- **Premature termination exposes Employers to damages claims** including loss of profit
- **Principal Agents must verify document accuracy** during tender/contract preparation phase

## Application to Proman Projects
**Critical Lessons for Donovan as Principal Agent:**

### 1. Pre-Contract Document Verification (Most Important!)
**Before contract signature, PA must verify:**
- [ ] BOQ matches the actual drawings and specifications
- [ ] BOQ is project-specific, not a generic template
- [ ] Drawings are for the correct project and site
- [ ] Site conditions have been properly investigated and disclosed
- [ ] Hazardous materials (asbestos, contamination) surveys completed and disclosed
- [ ] Quantities in BOQ are accurate and realistic

**If PA prepares the BOQ/contract documents:**
- Conduct thorough site survey
- Use project-specific BOQ (not template from another project!)
- Verify all quantities match drawings
- Disclose all known site conditions and risks
- Include provisional sums for uncertain items

**If PA receives BOQ/documents from Employer/QS:**
- **Review critically**—do not assume accuracy
- Cross-check BOQ against drawings
- Identify discrepancies BEFORE tender/contract signature
- Flag concerns to Employer in writing
- Recommend corrections before going to tender

### 2. During Construction - Variation Management
**If contractor raises BOQ discrepancy:**
- **Take it seriously**—do not dismiss as "contractor trying to claim extras"
- **Verify the discrepancy** independently
- **Compare BOQ to drawings and actual site conditions**
- **Document findings thoroughly**
- **If discrepancy is genuine**:
  - Issue variation instruction (Clause 6.19)
  - Price the variation fairly
  - Adjust contract price and timeline
  - Do NOT label as "contractor error/negligence"

### 3. Undisclosed Site Conditions
**If asbestos or other hazards discovered:**
- **Immediate work stoppage** in affected areas (safety first)
- **Specialist assessment** required
- **This is an Employer's Risk Event** under JBCC (typically)
- **Variation instruction must be issued** for remediation
- **EOT claim likely valid** for delay caused
- **Do NOT expect contractor to absorb costs**—this is Employer's obligation

### 4. Termination Decisions
**Before advising Employer to terminate contractor:**
- **Investigate root cause** of contractor's non-performance
- **Check if contract document defects are the cause**
- **If documents are defective**:
  - Termination is likely **wrongful**
  - Employer must first **correct the defects** via variations
  - Contractor is entitled to **fair variation pricing**
- **Document all facts** thoroughly before termination decision
- **Advise Employer of risks** of wrongful termination (damages including loss of profit)

**Mora (Notice of Breach) Considerations:**
- Before placing contractor in mora, verify contractor is actually in breach
- If contractor has valid grounds for suspension (defective documents, non-payment), mora is inappropriate
- Mora followed by termination for non-compliance can be wrongful if contractor had valid defenses

### 5. PA Liability Risk
**You could be liable to Employer if:**
- You prepare defective BOQ/contract documents (professional negligence)
- You fail to identify obvious document defects before contract signature
- You advise premature termination without investigating document defects
- You refuse valid variation claims by labeling them "contractor negligence"

**You could be liable to Contractor if:**
- You wrongfully reject valid variation claims
- You advise unlawful termination
- (Less likely, but possible in cases of gross negligence or collusion)

### 6. Practical Workflow
**At Tender Stage (if Proman is involved):**
1. Review all contract documents for accuracy and consistency
2. Verify BOQ matches drawings
3. Flag discrepancies to Employer before tender issued
4. Recommend corrections

**At Contract Award:**
1. Final document review before signature
2. Ensure contractor has accurate, project-specific documents

**During Construction:**
1. When contractor raises variation claim, investigate thoroughly
2. Do not automatically assume contractor is "trying to claim extras"
3. Verify facts independently
4. If claim is valid, process variation promptly and fairly
5. If Employer resists valid variation, explain legal consequences (this case)

**Before Termination:**
1. Investigate all facts
2. Check for contract document defects
3. Verify contractor is genuinely in breach vs. justified suspension
4. Advise Employer of wrongful termination risks
5. Document everything
