## Index by Topic

### Extensions of Time (EOT)
*Cases interpreting Clause 6.13 - Extension of Time procedures*

| Case Name | Year | Court/Forum | Key Issue | Outcome | File |
|-----------|------|-------------|-----------|---------|------|
| Pro-Khaya v City of Cape Town | 2025 | HC Western Cape | EOT claims & adjudication enforcement | City bound by adjudication determination on EOT | `Pro-Khaya_v_City_of_Cape_Town_2025.md` |
| Radon v NV Properties | Pre-2010 | HC/SCA | Time bars on EOT claims; revised claims | Initial claims time-barred; revised claims with new info valid | `Radon_v_NV_Properties.md` |

**Key Principles:**
- Principal Agent must act fairly and impartially when assessing EOT claims - even if favors contractor
- PA EOT determinations subject to 20-day dispute notice deadline; if not challenged, becomes final
- Contractors can revise EOT claims post-completion based on new information (not mere re-argument)
- PA must consider revised claims based on genuinely new information
- Strict procedural compliance essential - time bars rigorously enforced

### Variations (Clause 6.19)
*Cases on variation orders, scope changes, and Principal Agent instructions*

| Case Name | Year | Court/Forum | Key Issue | Outcome | File |
|-----------|------|-------------|-----------|---------|------|
| LBMC v Minister of Public Works | 2023 | High Court | Defective BOQ; undisclosed asbestos; wrongful termination | Contractor entitled to variations for BOQ errors and asbestos; termination premature | `LBMC_v_Minister_of_Public_Works_2023.md` |

**Key Principles:**
- Material errors in contract documents (BOQ, drawings) entitle contractor to variations
- BOQs must be project-specific and accurate - generic templates are insufficient
- Undisclosed site conditions (asbestos, contamination) trigger mandatory variation entitlements
- Variations cannot be dismissed as "contractor negligence" when caused by defective documents
- Employers cannot terminate contracts without first addressing fundamental document defects via variations
- PA must verify document accuracy during tender/contract preparation phase
- Wrongful termination exposes Employers to substantial damages including loss of profit

### Payment Disputes (Clause 6.25)
*Cases on payment certificates, withholding, and set-off*

| Case Name | Year | Court/Forum | Key Issue | Outcome | File |
|-----------|------|-------------|-----------|---------|------|
| Joob Joob v Stocks Mavundla | 2009 | SCA | Legal status of payment certificates | Payment certificates are "binding and equivalent to cash" | `Joob_Joob_v_Stocks_Mavundla_2009.md` |
| Inyatsi v National DPW | 2024 | High Court | Final Payment Certificate enforceability | Department bound to pay certified amount; certificate is liquid debt | `Inyatsi_v_National_DPW_2024.md` |
| Group Five v IDT | 2025 | High Court | Payment despite outstanding defects | Payment must be made within 21 days; defects handled separately under Clause 27 | `Group_Five_v_IDT_2025.md` |

| Synthesis v SBTJ | Unknown | High Court | Payment certificates after termination | Certificates remain enforceable post-termination; notice of dissatisfaction requires arbitration follow-through | `Synthesis_v_SBTJ.md` |

**Key Principles:**
- **FOUNDATIONAL:** Payment certificates are "binding and equivalent to cash" (Joob Joob SCA)
- Final Payment Certificates create liquid acknowledgments of debt
- Payment obligations are immediate (21 days under JBCC) and unconditional
- Defects do NOT suspend payment obligation - defects handled separately under Clause 27
- Principle of reciprocity does NOT apply - payment and defect rectification are separate processes
- Very limited grounds to dispute certificates: fraud, collusion, or manifest error only
- Employer's remedy for incorrect certificate is to sue PA/QS for damages, NOT withhold payment from contractor
- Payment certificates remain enforceable even after contract termination
- State entities and municipalities fully bound by payment certificates

### Practical/Final Completion (Clauses 6.27-6.28)
*Cases on completion certificates and defects liability*

| Case Name | Year | Court/Forum | Key Issue | Outcome | File |
|-----------|------|-------------|-----------|---------|------|
| Group Five v IDT | 2025 | High Court | FC Certificate with noted defects | FC Certificate can be issued with defects on snag list; payment not conditional on rectification | `Group_Five_v_IDT_2025.md` |

- Defects Liability Period (DLP) is the mechanism for managing post-completion defects
- Payment is NOT conditional on rectification of defects noted on snag list
- Building must be "substantially complete" and usable for PC to be issued
- Minor defects do not prevent certification - major defects requiring significant rework may prevent PC
- Snag list is legally binding - contractor obliged to rectify items during DLP

| Case Name | Year | Court/Forum | Key Issue | Outcome | File |

| Canton Trading v Fanti Bekker | 2022 | SCA | Arbitration agreement existence | Court (not arbitrator) determines if arbitration agreement exists; separability limits | `Canton_Trading_v_Fanti_Bekker_2022.md` |

**Key Principles:**

- Determinations provisionally binding unless overturned by subsequent arbitration/litigation
- Very limited grounds for court review: fraud, collusion, capriciousness, manifest injustice only
- **10-working-day notice of dissatisfaction deadline** - failure renders determination final and enforceable

- State entities, municipalities, and private parties all bound equally
