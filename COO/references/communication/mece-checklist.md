# MECE Validation Checklist

**Purpose:** Validate that your arguments are Mutually Exclusive (no overlap) and Collectively Exhaustive (no gaps). Use before finalizing any report or recommendation.

---

## Quick Test

Ask yourself these three questions:

1. **If I removed one argument, would another argument cover the same ground?**
   - Yes = You have overlap. Consolidate or differentiate.

2. **After reading all arguments, could someone say "but what about X?"**
   - Yes = You have a gap. Add the missing perspective.

3. **Does each argument directly support the main message?**
   - No = Remove it or revise your main message.

## The 5-Point MECE Checklist

### 1. No Overlap Check

For each argument, answer: **Is this point covered elsewhere?**

| Argument | Overlaps With? | Action Needed |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| [Argument 1] | None / [which one] | Keep / Merge / Differentiate |
| [Argument 2] | None / [which one] | Keep / Merge / Differentiate |
| [Argument 3] | None / [which one] | Keep / Merge / Differentiate |
| [Argument 4] | None / [which one] | Keep / Merge / Differentiate |

**Common overlap problems in construction PM:**
- "Cost impact" and "Budget variance" (same thing, different words)
- "Schedule delay" and "Programme slippage" (same thing)
- "Quality issues" and "Defects" (quality is broader, but often used interchangeably)

---

### 2. No Gaps Check

**Standard Gap Analysis Framework:**

Does your argument set cover all of these (if relevant)?

| Dimension | Covered? | By Which Argument? |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Cost** | Yes/No | |
| **Schedule** | Yes/No | |
| **Quality/Scope** | Yes/No | |
| **Risk** | Yes/No | |
| **Stakeholder impact** | Yes/No | |

**Alternative frameworks if above doesn't fit:**

**Past-Present-Future:**
| Time | Covered? |
|------|----------|
| What happened | Yes/No |
| Current status | Yes/No |
| Forecast/trend | Yes/No |

**Problem-Cause-Solution:**
| Element | Covered? |
|---------|----------|
| What's wrong | Yes/No |
| Why it happened | Yes/No |
| What to do | Yes/No |

---

### 3. Direct Support Check

For each argument, complete this sentence:

> "This argument supports the main message because ___________"

If you can't complete it clearly, the argument either:
- Doesn't belong (remove it)
- Belongs to a different main message (revise structure)
- Is interesting but tangential (move to appendix)

---

### 4. Logical Grouping Check

**Are your arguments grouped by a single organizing principle?**

| Grouping Type | Example | Your Structure |
|---------------|---------|----------------|
| By time | Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3 | |
| By component | Cost, Schedule, Quality | |
| By stakeholder | Client, Contractor, Consultant | |
| By geography | Site A, Site B, Site C | |
| By priority | Critical, Important, Nice-to-have | |
| By cause | Root cause 1, Root cause 2 | |

**Warning signs of bad grouping:**
- Arguments 1 and 2 are grouped by time, but 3 is grouped by topic
- Some arguments are at different levels of detail than others
- Reader can't predict what the next argument will address

---

### 5. Evidence Distribution Check

Each argument should have comparable evidence strength.

| Argument | Evidence Quality | Evidence Quantity |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| [Arg 1] | Strong/Medium/Weak | [X] data points |
| [Arg 2] | Strong/Medium/Weak | [X] data points |
| [Arg 3] | Strong/Medium/Weak | [X] data points |

**Red flags:**
- One argument has lots of evidence, others have little (rebalance)
- Evidence is opinion-based for one, data-based for others (standardize)
- Most compelling argument is buried at the end (reorder)

---

## Pre-Submission Validation

Before finalizing, answer YES to all:

- [ ] Each argument makes ONE distinct point
- [ ] No two arguments could be merged without loss
- [ ] A skeptical reader wouldn't say "you missed X"
- [ ] Every argument has at least one evidence point
- [ ] Arguments are in strongest-to-weakest or logical sequence order
- [ ] I can explain the grouping logic in one sentence

## Common MECE Structures for Construction PM

### Budget Reports
```
1. Cost Performance (where we are vs. baseline)
2. Variance Drivers (why we're there)
3. Forecast (where we're heading)
```

### Project Status
```
1. Progress (what's been achieved)
2. Issues (what's blocking us)
3. Outlook (what happens next)
```

### Risk Assessment
```
1. Financial risks
2. Programme risks
3. External/compliance risks
```

### Decision Recommendation
```
1. Strategic fit (why this matters)
2. Financial case (cost/benefit)
3. Implementation feasibility (can we do it)
```

### Contractor Performance
```
1. Quality of work
2. Speed of delivery
3. Collaboration/communication
```

### Post-Project Review
```
1. What went well (keep doing)
2. What went poorly (stop doing)
3. What to try next time (start doing)
```

## Quick Fix Guide

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Two arguments overlap | Merge into one OR differentiate the specific angle |
| Gap in coverage | Add missing dimension OR acknowledge limitation |
| Argument doesn't support main message | Remove it OR revise main message |
| Uneven evidence | Find more data OR downgrade argument importance |
| Unclear grouping | Pick ONE organizing principle and stick to it |

---

## AI Validation Prompt

Copy this to validate your structure:

```
Review this argument structure for MECE compliance:

MAIN MESSAGE:
[Your one-sentence conclusion]

ARGUMENTS:
1. [First argument]
2. [Second argument]
3. [Third argument]
4. [Fourth argument if applicable]

For each argument, assess:
- Does it overlap with any other argument?
- Does it directly support the main message?
- Is there a gap this argument set doesn't cover?

Provide specific recommendations to improve the structure.
```
