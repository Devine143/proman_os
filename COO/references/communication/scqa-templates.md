## Usage Notes

1. **Don't over-fill** - Empty sections are fine if not relevant
2. **Lead with the main message** - Even within templates, put conclusion first
3. **Quantify everything** - Rands, days, percentages wherever possible
4. **One decision per document** - Complex issues need separate communications
5. **Match formality to audience** - Developer gets summary; contractor gets detail
