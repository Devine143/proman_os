# Pyramid Principle Quick Reference

**Purpose:** Practical guide for structuring all client-facing communications. Use this before writing any report, email, or status update.

---

## The 30-Second Version

**Lead with the answer, then support it.**

1. **Main Message** - Your conclusion/recommendation in ONE sentence
2. **Key Arguments** - 2-4 supporting points (logically grouped)
3. **Evidence** - Data/facts that prove each argument

**If the reader stopped after sentence one, would they know what to do?** If not, rewrite.

---

## SCQA Framework

Use this structure for any communication requiring action or decision.

| Component | What It Does | Construction PM Example |
|-----------|--------------|------------------------|
| **S**ituation | Current state (facts everyone agrees on) | "We're at month 4 of a 12-month build, 35% complete" |
| **C**omplication | What changed / the problem | "Structural steel delivery delayed 6 weeks" |
| **Q**uestion | What needs deciding | "How do we recover the schedule?" |
| **A**nswer | Your recommendation | "Fast-track interior rough-in while awaiting steel" |

### Fill-in Template

```
SITUATION: [Project name] is currently [status/progress].

COMPLICATION: However, [problem/change] has created [impact].

QUESTION: The key decision is: [specific question]?

ANSWER: We recommend [specific action] because [primary reason].
```

## MECE Argument Grouping

**MECE = Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive**

Arguments should:
- Not overlap (each point is distinct)
- Leave no gaps (together they cover everything relevant)

### Common MECE Structures for Construction PM

**By Time:**
- What happened (past)
- What's happening now (current)
- What will happen (forecast)

**By Impact Area:**
- Cost impact
- Schedule impact
- Quality/scope impact

**By Stakeholder:**
- Client perspective
- Contractor perspective
- Consultant perspective

**By Phase:**
- Design issues
- Procurement issues
- Construction issues

## Quick Validation Checklist

Before sending any report or recommendation, verify:

- [ ] **Main message is first** - Conclusion appears in opening paragraph
- [ ] **Arguments are grouped** - Related points clustered together
- [ ] **No overlap** - Each argument makes a distinct point
- [ ] **No gaps** - All relevant considerations covered
- [ ] **Evidence supports** - Each claim has data/facts behind it
- [ ] **Action is clear** - Reader knows exactly what to do

## Common Formats

### Budget Status Report (Pyramid Structure)

```
MAIN MESSAGE (Executive Summary)
"Project budget is R2.1M under baseline with CPI of 1.05,
primarily due to favorable steel pricing. No action required."

SUPPORTING ARGUMENTS:
1. Cost Performance (CPI/SPI metrics with variances)
2. Risk Status (contingency consumption, emerging risks)
3. Forecast (completion estimate, cash flow)

EVIDENCE:
- Detailed variance tables (appendix)
- EVM calculations
- Source documentation
```

### Project Status Update (SCQA Structure)

```
SITUATION:
[Project] is at [% complete], [X] days into a [Y]-day schedule.

COMPLICATION:
[Describe the key issue/change/risk this period]

RECOMMENDATION:
[Specific action needed, by whom, by when]

SUPPORTING DETAIL:
- Schedule status: [status]
- Budget status: [status]
- Quality status: [status]
- Key risks: [list]
```

### Decision Request Memo

```
DECISION REQUIRED:
[One sentence stating exactly what decision is needed]

BACKGROUND:
[2-3 sentences of essential context]

OPTIONS:
Option A: [Description] - [Pros/Cons]
Option B: [Description] - [Pros/Cons]

RECOMMENDATION:
[Your recommended option with 1-2 key reasons]

DEADLINE:
[When decision is needed and why]
```

### Escalation Communication

```
ISSUE: [One sentence describing the problem]

IMPACT: [Quantified consequence if unresolved]

ROOT CAUSE: [Brief explanation]

PROPOSED RESOLUTION: [Your recommended action]

SUPPORT NEEDED: [Specific ask from recipient]

TIMELINE: [When this needs to be resolved]
```

## AI Prompts for Pyramid Structuring

### Generate Main Message
```
Help me craft a main message for this situation:
- Current state: [describe]
- Key problem: [describe]
- My recommended action: [describe]
- Audience: [property developer / contractor / consultant]

Structure it as: Situation → Complication → Question → Answer
Keep the answer to ONE actionable sentence.
```

### Validate Argument Structure
```
Review this argument structure for MECE compliance:

Main Message: [your conclusion]

Arguments:
1. [first point]
2. [second point]
3. [third point]

Check for:
- Overlapping arguments
- Logical gaps
- Arguments that don't support the main message
```

### Transform Data into Pyramid Report
```
I have this data: [paste data summary]

Create a pyramid-structured summary:
1. Main message (one sentence conclusion)
2. 3 supporting argument groups (MECE)
3. Key evidence points for each group

Audience: [describe]
Purpose: [decision needed / information only / action required]
```

## When NOT to Use Pyramid

- **Technical specifications** - Details need to be complete, not summarized
- **Contractual documents** - Legal precision over persuasion
- **Data dumps** - When client specifically requests raw information
- **Brainstorming sessions** - Exploration before conclusion
