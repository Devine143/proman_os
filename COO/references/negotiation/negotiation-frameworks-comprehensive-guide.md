## Negotiation Frameworks and Models

The sources present several comprehensive structures for organizing negotiation strategy, preparation, and execution.

### I. Foundational Models

| Framework/Model | Description & Purpose | Source(s) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Principled Negotiation / Negotiation on the Merits** | A non-positional approach designed to produce wise outcomes efficiently and amicably. It insists on deciding issues based on their merits, looking for mutual gains, and using fair standards independent of will. The method is "hard on the merits, soft on the people". | |
| **Information-Based Bargaining** | A "skeptical school" of negotiation that emphasizes tailoring situational strategies rather than relying on a single formula. It focuses on solid planning, careful listening, and attending to signals provided by the other party's conduct. | |
| **The Getting More Model / Four Quadrant Negotiation Model** | A comprehensive problem-solving model designed to structure negotiations and provide a checklist of tools, organizing strategy development and execution. | |
| **Investigative Negotiation** | A mind-set and methodology that approaches negotiation like a detective, focusing on discovering the often hidden or guarded interests, priorities, needs, and constraints of the other party. | |
| **Behavioral Change Stairway Model (BCSM)** | A five-stage psychological model used in crisis negotiation to move a counterpart from listening toward influencing behavior: **Active Listening, Empathy, Rapport, Influence, and Behavioral Change**. | |

### II. Core Negotiation Pillars (Foundations/Principles)

These are the fundamental elements that dictate negotiation success.

| Framework/Set | Core Pillars/Elements | Description | Source(s) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Four Points of Principled Negotiation** | **People:** Separate the people from the problem.<br>**Interests:** Focus on interests, not positions.<br>**Options:** Invent multiple options looking for mutual gains.<br>**Criteria:** Insist that the result be based on some objective standard. | These points are relevant across the three stages of negotiation (Analysis, Planning, Discussion). | |
| **The Six Foundations of Effective Negotiation** | 1. **Your Bargaining Style**<br>2. **Your Goals and Expectations**<br>3. **Authoritative Standards and Norms**<br>4. **Relationships**<br>5. **The Other Party's Interests**<br>6. **Leverage** | These factors rest on deep psychological foundations and reliably prepare you for success. | |
| **The Twelve Strategies of Getting More** | Goals Are Paramount; It's About Them; Be Incremental; Emotional Payments; Communicate & Frame; Use Their Standards; Be Transparent/Ethical; Trading Items of Unequal Value; Make a List; Embrace Differences; Each Situation Is Different; Find the Real Problem. | These strategies form the building blocks for the Getting More Model. | |

### III. Stages and Process Models

| Model | Stages/Steps | Source(s) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Negotiation Process (Shell)** | 1. **Preparing Your Strategy** (Step 1)<br>2. **Exchanging Information** (Step 2)<br>3. **Opening and Making Concessions** (Step 3)<br>4. **Closing and Gaining Commitment** (Step 4) | Negotiation is a dance that moves through these four recognizable steps. | |
| **The Principled Negotiation Process** | 1. **Analysis** (diagnosing the existing situation)<br>2. **Planning** (generating ideas and options)<br>3. **Discussion** (communicating back and forth) | This process organizes how the Four Points of Principled Negotiation are applied. | |
| **The Getting More Model (Four Quadrants)** | 1. **Quadrant I: Problems & Goals** (Goals, Problems, Parties, What if no deal?, Preparation)<br>2. **Quadrant II: Situation Analysis** (Needs/interests, Perceptions, Communication, Standards, Reexamine goals)<br>3. **Quadrant III: Options/Risk Reduction** (Brainstorm, Incremental steps, Third parties, Framing, Alternatives)<br>4. **Quadrant IV: Actions** (Best options/Priorities, Who presents, Process, Commitments/Incentives, Next steps) | This model provides an organizing principle for effective preparation. | |

## Key Negotiation Techniques and Concepts

### I. Situational Analysis and Preparation Tools

| Concept/Technique | Description | Source(s) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Situational Matrix** | A method to match negotiation style and strategy to the situation based on perceived conflict and the importance of future relationship (e.g., Transaction, Relationship, Balanced Concerns, Tacit Coordination). | |
| **BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement)** | The course of action a negotiator will pursue if the current negotiation is unsuccessful. Developing a good BATNA is the most effective course of action against a seemingly powerful negotiator and increases your capacity to affect the outcome. | |
| **WATNA (Worst Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement)** | Recommended for focusing on the risks of not achieving an agreement, rather than focusing solely on the best option (BATNA). | |
| **Scoring System** | A tool to organize interests and priorities in complex negotiations, listing each issue and weighting it according to its importance using a common metric (like points or dollar values). | |
| **System 2 List** | Planning tool used at the beginning of a period (month/year) to list upcoming high-stakes, complex negotiations that require deliberative (System 2) thinking. | |
| **Negotiation One Sheet** | A simple preparatory exercise that summarizes the goal, includes an accusation audit, prepared labels, calibrated questions, and noncash offers customized for the specific negotiation. | |
| **Role Reversal** | Spending time asking why the other side might say "no" to your proposal to gain breakthrough insights. | |
| **Analogical Reasoning** | The process of learning by comparing and contrasting multiple prior negotiations or cases on their structural and conceptual elements to extract abstract principles and generalize learning. | |
| **Outsider Lens** | A less biased perspective adopted when one is not personally involved in a decision or negotiation, helping to generalize across situations and identify relevant patterns. | |
| **Visualizing Success** | Mentally rehearsing the bargaining process and imagining the specific outcome or goal, which can enhance self-confidence and commitment. | |

### II. Communication, Emotion, and Psychological Tools

| Concept/Technique | Description | Source(s) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Active Listening** | Foundation of the BCSM. Techniques include Mirroring, Silences, and the Late-Night FM DJ Voice, used to slow conversations and encourage the counterpart to reveal information. | |
| **Late-Night FM DJ Voice** | A calm, slow, deep voice used with downward inflection; designed to convey approachability, control, and authority. | |
| **Mirroring (Isopraxism)** | Repeating the last one to three words of the counterpart to build rapport, elicit information, and encourage elaboration. | |
| **Tactical Empathy** | Recognizing the counterpart's perspective and verbalizing that perspective to gain trust and understanding. | |
| **Labeling** | Naming the counterpart's emotions or situation aloud (e.g., "It seems like \_\_\_\_\_") to defuse negative dynamics, gain trust, and confirm their perspective. | |
| **Accusation Audit** | A preparatory tool that involves listing every terrible thing the counterpart could say about you or your weaknesses, and then stating them preemptively to neutralize the negative and take "the sting out". | |
| **Summaries / Paraphrasing** | Rearticulating and emotionally affirming the counterpart's worldview to trigger a "That's Right" response. | |
| **The Consistency Principle** | Human nature's drive to maintain an appearance of consistency and fairness in words and deeds. Skilled use of this yields **Normative Leverage**. | |
| **Normative Leverage** | The skillful use of standards, norms, and coherent positioning to gain advantage, maximized when the asserted standards are legitimate and relevant to the other party. | |
| **Positioning Themes** | Crisp, memorable phrases or frameworks that define the negotiation problem, tying bargaining positions to overall interests and norms. | |
| **Core Concerns (Fisher/Shapiro)** | Five psychological interests that, if trampled, generate strong negative emotions, but if attended to, build rapport: **autonomy, appreciation, affiliation, role, and status**. | |
| **Common Enemies** | A tool to bring parties closer together and make negotiation easier by finding something mutually disliked (like the weather or bureaucracy). | |
| **Reciprocity Norm** | The expectation that parties will repay or reward others for benevolent or helpful behaviors. Can be leveraged by sharing credible information. | |
| **Transparency** | Explicitly sharing strategies and intentions with the other side (e.g., "I'm in a bad mood" or sharing negotiation tools) to minimize feeling manipulated and improve the negotiation process. | |

### III. Value Creation and Concessions

| Concept/Technique | Description | Source(s) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Logrolling / Issue Trading** | The act of making trade-offs across multiple issues, giving the other side something they value relatively more in return for something you value relatively more, which maximizes the value of the package deal. | |
| **Negotiate Multiple Issues Simultaneously** | Strategy for value creation that ensures the possibility of logrolling and reveals the other party's true relative priorities. | |
| **Package Offers** | Instead of offering or demanding on a single issue, propose a deal across all issues, allowing the counterpart to signal flexibility on some issues while making demands on others. | |
| **Contingency Contracts** | Clauses that leverage differences in beliefs or expectations about the future to create value, often by linking outcomes to future events. They must be "incentive compatible". | |
| **Dovetailing** | Inventing options that capitalize on differences (interests, priorities, beliefs, risks) by seeking items that are of low cost to you and high benefit to them, and vice versa ("Vive la différence!"). | |
| **If . . . Then Formulation** | Using this structure (e.g., "IF you give us A and B, THEN we might consider concessions on X and Y") ensures that a concession is always linked to a mutual concession. | |
| **Striving for "That's Right"** | The goal of communication, superior to a simple "Yes," because it signifies that the counterpart feels understood and affirmed, leading to agreement execution. | |
| **Mastering "No"** | Actively seeking the word "No," as it is protective, defines boundaries, generates momentum, and is the true start of negotiation. | |

### IV. Closing and Hard Bargaining Techniques

| Concept/Technique | Description | Source(s) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ackerman Model** | A four-step haggling system for getting your price: 1) Set target price; 2) Set first offer at 65% of target; 3) Calculate three raises of decreasing increments (to 85%, 95%, 100%); 4) Use empathy and "No" techniques to get counterpart to counter before increasing your offer. | |
| **Scarcity Effect / Competition** | Using the human tendency to want things more when supply is running out, often by emphasizing that what you have is in great demand or dwindling fast. | |
| **Anchoring Emotions / Loss Aversion** | Preemptively acknowledging the counterpart's fears (accusation audit) to anchor their emotions in preparation for a loss, thus making them jump at the chance to avoid it (loss aversion). | |
| **Odd Number Anchoring** | Using specific, non-round numbers (e.g., $102,500) in offers to make them seem authoritative, researched, and less arbitrary. | |
| **Calibrated Questions** | Open-ended "How" or "What" questions designed to give the counterpart the illusion of control while implicitly asking them to solve your problem (e.g., "How am I supposed to do that?"). (Avoid "Why"). | |
| **Negotiation Jujitsu** | A strategy to counter positional bargaining by directing attention to the merits: don't attack their position (look behind it); don't defend your ideas (invite criticism); ask questions and pause. | |
| **One-Text Procedure** | A mediation technique where a third party drafts a proposed agreement (the "one text"), asks parties for criticism, and iteratively revises the text until the mediator cannot improve it further, allowing parties to focus on interests rather than defending positions. | |

### V. Ethics, Deception, and Leverage

| Concept/Technique | Description | Source(s) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Three Ethical Frameworks** | 1. **Poker School:** Negotiation is a game; conduct is ethical if lawful.<br>2. **Idealist School:** Same ethics apply as in everyday social life.<br>3. **Pragmatist School:** Balance relationship maintenance with achieving goals; use deception only if necessary and consistent with maintaining working relationships. | |
| **Blocking Techniques** | Sophisticated, potentially deceptive methods (often used by Pragmatists) to avoid outright lying while protecting leverage, such as deflecting questions or responding indirectly. | |
| **The Rule of Three** | A tactic to test if a "Yes" is real or counterfeit by using calibrated questions, summaries, or labels to get the counterpart to re-affirm their commitment at least times. | |
| **Three Types of Leverage** | 1. **Positive Leverage:** The ability to provide things the other party wants.<br>2. **Negative Leverage:** The power to take away things or inflict pain/harm.<br>3. **Normative Leverage:** Using the other party's norms and standards against them to gain advantage. | |
| **Finding Black Swans** | Uncovering the "unknown unknowns"—three to five pieces of hidden, transformative information that change the course of a negotiation. These often relate to the counterpart's "religion" (worldview, constraints, or hidden desires). | |
| **7-38-55 Percent Rule** | Communication model asserting that only 7% of a message is based on words, while 38% comes from tone of voice and 55% from body language/face. Incongruence is a reliable indicator of discomfort or deception. | |

## Negotiation Styles and Assessment

| Framework/Tool | Negotiation Styles | Description | Source(s) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Shell's Five Strategies/Styles** | Competing, Collaborating, Compromising, Accommodating, Avoiding | Categories incorporated into the Bargaining Styles Assessment Tool and the Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument (TKI). | |
| **Voss's Three Categories** | **Accommodators:** Focus primarily on the relationship.<br>**Assertives:** Focus primarily on their own goals.<br>**Analysts:** Focus primarily on data and preparation. | The Black Swan rule advises treating these types as they need to be treated, not as you want to be treated. | |
| **Bargaining Styles Assessment Tool** | A proprietary instrument designed to probe negotiation instincts and evaluate results against a standardized grid of global executives. | |

## Quick Reference: Proman Contractor Negotiation Applications

### Pre-Negotiation Preparation
1. **BATNA/WATNA Analysis**: Know your alternatives before entering contractor discussions
2. **Scoring System**: Weight priorities (price, timeline, quality, reputation) for contractor selection
3. **Accusation Audit**: List potential contractor objections before pricing discussions
4. **Negotiation One Sheet**: Prepare calibrated questions and non-cash offers (payment terms, project phasing)

### During Negotiation
1. **Principled Negotiation**: Focus on interests (project completion, quality, timeline) not positions (specific price)
2. **Tactical Empathy & Labeling**: "It seems like you're concerned about material cost volatility"
3. **Calibrated Questions**: "How can we structure this to work within your capacity?" or "What would it take to meet this timeline?"
4. **Mirroring**: Repeat key concerns to encourage elaboration and build rapport
5. **Package Offers**: Bundle scope, timeline, and payment terms rather than negotiating individually

### Value Creation
1. **Logrolling**: Trade off payment terms for better pricing, or timeline flexibility for quality guarantees
2. **Contingency Contracts**: Link bonuses to early completion or penalties to delays
3. **Dovetailing**: Find low-cost/high-value exchanges (e.g., longer payment terms for bulk discount)

### Closing Techniques
1. **Ackerman Model**: Start at 65% of target, move in decreasing increments (85%, 95%, 100%)
2. **Odd Number Anchoring**: Use specific numbers (R487,500 not R500,000)
3. **Rule of Three**: Confirm commitment three times using different methods

### Relationship Management
1. **Core Concerns**: Respect contractor autonomy, appreciate expertise, acknowledge role/status
2. **Transparency**: Share constraints openly to build trust for long-term relationships
3. **"That's Right" Not "Yes"**: Ensure contractors feel heard before finalizing agreements

### Leverage
1. **Positive**: Offer repeat business, referrals, favorable payment terms
2. **Negative**: BATNA alternatives, project complexity
3. **Normative**: Use industry standards, JBCC contract terms, PMP best practices
