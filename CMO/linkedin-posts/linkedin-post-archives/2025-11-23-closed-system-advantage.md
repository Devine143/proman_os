ChatGPT will confidently cite contract clauses that don't exist.

When you're negotiating million-rand contracts, "probably correct" isn't good enough.

That's why I switched to NotebookLM for professional research. Here's the difference that changes everything:

**NotebookLM is a closed system.** It only works with sources you provide.

When I ask about JBCC contract provisions, it quotes the actual JBCC 6.2 document I uploaded. When I ask about Cape Town building regulations, it references the specific municipal policy PDFs in my notebook.

**What this means in practice:**

-> Dramatically fewer hallucinations
-> Responses grounded in your actual documents
-> Answers you can verify in seconds
-> Citations you can stake your professional reputation on

**Here's my setup for regulatory compliance:**

I uploaded:
-> Cape Town Municipal Planning By-Law
-> National Building Regulations (SANS 10400)
-> Tall Buildings Policy
-> Heritage Western Cape guidelines

For any new project, I run a comprehensive compliance check:

"What are all the regulatory requirements for a 15-story mixed-use building in the CBD? Flag any conflicts between municipal and national regulations."

**The result:** I caught a heritage notification requirement that would have delayed our project by 6 weeks.

Total research time: 35 minutes vs. what would have been a full day with traditional methods.

Generic AI is great for brainstorming. But for professional decisions where accuracy matters, a closed system changes everything.

I still double-check critical clauses directly. But NotebookLM gets me 90% there, and I know exactly where to look for confirmation.
