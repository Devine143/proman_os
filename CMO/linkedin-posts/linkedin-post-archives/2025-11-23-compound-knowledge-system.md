After 6 months, my NotebookLM system knows more about my specific professional context than any generic AI ever could.

Here's why that matters more than you think.

Most people use AI as a one-time research tool. Ask a question, get an answer, move on.

**I built mine to compound.**

Every conversation I have with NotebookLM builds on previous ones. Every document I add makes the system smarter. Every outcome I record improves future recommendations.

**Here's a concrete example:**

In month one, I asked about standard P&G percentages and got textbook answers from my industry guides.

But after I uploaded my notes from three actual negotiations - including what worked, what didn't, and final outcomes - the recommendations got sharper.

By month four, when I asked about P&G positioning, NotebookLM referenced not just industry benchmarks but patterns from my own negotiation history:

"In your previous projects, you've successfully negotiated P&G reductions when you led with programme risk rather than cost comparisons."

**That's the compound effect in action.**

**The learning loop I follow:**

Before any significant decision:
-> Open relevant notebook
-> Have a focused conversation about the specific situation
-> Generate a briefing doc summarizing key points

After any significant outcome:
-> Document what happened (wins, losses, surprises)
-> Upload notes to the relevant notebook
-> The knowledge base compounds over time

NotebookLM isn't just a learning tool. It's professional infrastructure.

Every regulation you upload, every contract you add, every precedent you document - it all compounds into a system that makes you more effective at your actual job.

What professional knowledge would compound most in your work if you systematically captured it?
