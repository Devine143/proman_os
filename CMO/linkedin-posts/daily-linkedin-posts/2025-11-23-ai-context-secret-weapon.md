"Generate a risk register" produces generic garbage.

"Read these specific files and create a risk register based on this project's actual conditions" produces useful drafts.

The difference? Context.

Here's what most people are missing about AI collaboration:

**The quality of your output directly reflects the quality of your direction.**

I discovered this the hard way. Spent months getting mediocre results from AI before realizing I was the problem.

Now every project folder has a CLAUDE.md file that tells AI about the project context:

- Project overview and value
- Key stakeholders and their preferences
- Current phase and priorities
- Document standards and formatting rules
- My personal preferences for communication style

**When AI reads this file, every response is contextually aware.**

It knows the project. It knows the stakeholders. It knows my preferences.

The maintenance takes maybe 5 minutes per week per active project. The improvement in output quality? Dramatic.

**Here's the honest truth:**

AI once rated a risk as "low probability" that anyone familiar with Cape Town municipal approvals would know is actually high probability.

Context isn't just for AI to give better answers.

Context forces you to articulate what you actually know about the problem.

The more you explain, the clearer your thinking becomes.

The clearer your thinking, the better the collaboration.

Context isn't for AI. Context is for you.

What context do you give AI before asking for help?
