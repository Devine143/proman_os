"AI will save you time" is vague.

Let me be specific about what it actually costs and returns.

**My Claude Code investment:**

Financial: R800-1500/month (~$45-85 USD) for heavy usage

Time investment:
- Initial setup: 2-3 hours
- Learning effective prompting: About a week
- Per-project setup: 30-60 minutes
- Ongoing maintenance: 5-10 minutes per project per week

**My return:**

I estimate I save 8-10 hours per week on administrative documentation.

Project charters that took a full day now start as comprehensive drafts in 15 minutes.

Meeting preparation and follow-up that consumed my evenings now takes minutes.

Risk assessments that required half a day of reading produce systematic drafts quickly.

**But here's the honest caveat:**

I was already somewhat technical before starting.

If you've never opened a terminal before, there's a learning curve. You need comfort with command-line basics, or willingness to invest time learning.

**This approach works if you:**
- Create documents as a core part of your work
- Work with complex information that needs synthesis
- Have repeatable workflows that follow patterns
- Value strategic thinking time over administrative time

**This might not be for you if:**
- You need AI that "just works" without setup
- Your work is primarily relationship-based rather than document-based
- You expect AI to replace professional judgment

The ROI is clear for my work style.

But honest self-assessment about fit matters more than following hype.

What's your honest AI ROI calculation?
