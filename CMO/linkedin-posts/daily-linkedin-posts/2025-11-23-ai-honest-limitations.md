AI almost cost me a project because I trusted it too much.

Claude generated a work breakdown structure for a heritage building renovation that completely omitted the Heritage Western Cape approval phase.

It treated the project like new construction rather than a protected structure.

I caught it during my review. But only because I have a mental checklist of required phases for different project types.

**Here's the truth nobody talks about:**

AI doesn't know what it doesn't know.

Your expertise needs to fill those gaps.

After three months of using Claude Code as my business partner, here's my honest assessment:

**The good:**
- Complex documents that took hours now take minutes to draft
- I surface potential risks more systematically
- My thinking time increased because admin time decreased
- I can take on more projects without drowning in paperwork

**The honest limitations:**
- Claude sometimes misunderstands construction terminology
- It can be overconfident with local context
- Complex regulatory requirements need human expertise
- The outputs are drafts, not finished products

**The accountability reality:**

My professional registration means I'm responsible for the quality and accuracy of project documentation.

AI assistance doesn't change that responsibility.

AI is a tool that amplifies your professional judgment.

Not a replacement for it.

The people who fail with AI treat it like an answer machine.

The people who succeed treat it like a thinking partner who needs validation.

What AI limitation taught you the most important lesson?
