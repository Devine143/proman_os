I used to think of AI as a research assistant.

Good for answering questions. Limited for real work.

Then I reframed it completely.

Now I think of AI as a junior team member who handles document drafting, initial analysis, and administrative tasks while I focus on work that actually requires my expertise.

**Here's the shift that changed everything:**

The old mental model: AI gives suggestions I manually implement.

The new mental model: AI creates first drafts I review with professional judgment.

Concrete example from last month:

A client sent 47 pages of tender documentation. The old way? Half a day reading everything, manually identifying risks, building a register in Excel.

The new way? I pointed Claude Code at the folder and asked it to create a preliminary risk register.

Fifteen minutes later, I had a comprehensive draft.

**The key word is "draft."**

I still review everything with my professional judgment. AI surfaces potential risks. I validate which ones are real for this specific project.

Buried on page 38 was a note about soil contamination testing that would trigger additional municipal approvals. I might have caught it eventually. Claude flagged it immediately.

**The projects didn't get easier.**

But the ratio of strategic thinking to administrative burden shifted dramatically in favor of the work that matters.

AI isn't replacing my expertise.

It's amplifying it.

What administrative work consumes your strategic thinking time?
