I almost scrolled past Claude Code because it was "for software engineers."

I'm a construction project manager. I don't write code.

But something made me curious: what if "code" wasn't the point?

Three months later, Claude Code has become my silent business partner.

Not for coding. For everything else.

**Here's what makes it different from regular AI chat:**

Regular AI lives in a browser tab. You copy-paste documents one at a time. Context disappears when you close the window.

Claude Code lives in your actual file system. It reads entire project folders without manual uploads. It creates and edits documents directly. It remembers your preferences.

Think of it like this:

Regular AI is a consultant you visit in their office, handing over one document at a time.

Claude Code is a colleague who sits at the desk next to you, has access to your entire filing cabinet, and can actually draft documents while you're talking.

**For project management, this means I can say:**

"Read the tender documents in my current project folder, analyze the scope, and create a preliminary risk register based on what you find."

And it actually does it. Reading my real files (all 47 pages across multiple documents), understanding the project context, producing a document I can use.

The tool marketed to engineers became my biggest productivity unlock as a PM.

Stop asking "Is this tool for me?"

Start asking "What could I build with this?"

What tools have you dismissed because of their marketing?
