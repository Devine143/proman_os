<p>My days are filled with risk registers, stakeholder matrices, project charters, and work breakdown structures. I coordinate consultants, manage client expectations, and keep multi-million-rand developments from falling apart.</p><p>The promise of Claude Code wasn’t <em>“write code faster.”</em><br>It was: <strong>“an AI that works alongside you in your real environment.”</strong><br>An AI that reads your files, understands your context, and executes complex tasks while you think.</p><p>Three months later, Claude Code has become my silent business partner.<br>Not for coding—<strong>for everything else.</strong></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Why a “coding tool” works for project management</strong></p><p>Here’s what makes Claude Code different from normal AI tools:</p><p><strong>Regular AI chat:</strong><br>– Lives in a browser tab<br>– You upload documents manually<br>– You implement all changes yourself<br>– Context resets constantly<br>– Every conversation starts from zero</p><p><strong>Claude Code:</strong><br>– Lives in your actual file system<br>– Reads entire project folders automatically<br>– Writes and edits documents directly<br>– Remembers your workflow through config files<br>– Builds on its own previous outputs</p><p>If traditional AI is like visiting a consultant, Claude Code is like having a <strong>colleague sitting next to you with access to your whole project environment.</strong></p><p>For example, I can say:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Read the tender documents in this folder, analyse the scope, and create a preliminary risk register based on what you find.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Claude Code <strong>actually does it</strong>—reading all 47 pages across multiple documents, understanding the project, and producing a draft I can use immediately.</p><p><em>Important caveat:</em> You need minimal comfort with the command line. If you’ve never opened a terminal, there <em>is</em> a learning curve—but the payoff is enormous.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>My actual PM workflows with Claude Code</strong></p><p>These are the real ways I use Claude Code daily—where it excels, and where it has burned me.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>1. Risk assessment with broader coverage</strong></p><p>The old way: hours of reading tender docs, site reports, proposals, and manually identifying risks.</p><p>With Claude Code:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Read all documents in /Tender. Identify risks across site conditions, regulatory compliance, stakeholder conflicts, budget, and timeline. Draft a risk register with probability, impact, and mitigations based on my standard.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Fifteen minutes later I had a clean draft.<br>It even found a buried line on page 38 of a geotech report about soil contamination testing—something that could have delayed approvals by two months.</p><p><strong>Key point:</strong><br>Claude produces <strong>drafts</strong>, not decisions.<br>I validate every risk with professional judgement.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>2. Stakeholder analysis with depth</strong></p><p>Stakeholder management is everything in construction.<br>I point Claude Code at my project folder and ask:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Based on project charters and meeting notes, create a stakeholder matrix with interests, influence, concerns, and engagement strategies. Flag potential conflicts.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Claude produces a surprisingly contextual analysis.<br>But here’s the limitation:</p><p>Once, it flagged a contractor as “high conflict risk” based on a months-old dispute documented in notes—even though the relationship is now excellent.</p><p><strong>Lesson:</strong><br>Claude understands documents, not <em>human dynamics</em>.<br>You still own the relational intelligence.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>3. Project charters that consolidate real information</strong></p><p>Instead of spending a day compiling a charter, I now say:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Read the kickoff notes, proposal, and site assessment. Draft a project charter following PMBOK: purpose, scope, deliverables, constraints, assumptions, timeline, and success criteria.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Claude produces a solid baseline.<br>I refine the strategic parts, validate details, and adjust tone for the client.</p><p><strong>Professional responsibility reminder:</strong><br>AI supports your expertise—it doesn’t replace accountability.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>4. Work breakdown structures that start strong</strong></p><p>Creating a WBS from scratch is tedious.<br>Now I say:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Based on scope-statement.md, create a WBS to level 3/4, including design, approvals, site establishment, structure, envelope, finishes, externals, and handover.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Claude produces a structured WBS following typical construction sequencing.</p><p><strong>Where it failed:</strong><br>For a heritage renovation, it completely omitted Heritage Western Cape approvals.<br>It assumed regular new construction.</p><p>I now specify: <em>“This is a heritage building with HWC requirements.”</em></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>5. Meeting preparation and follow-up</strong></p><p>Before meetings:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Read previous minutes + issues log + status report. Prepare an agenda with decisions needed and talking points.”</em></p></blockquote><p>After meetings:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Transform my rough notes into formal minutes with action items and due dates. Update issues log.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Admin tasks that used to drain hours now take minutes.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>The setup that makes this work</strong></p><p>Claude Code isn’t magic—you need structure.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Project folder structure</strong></p><p>I use a PMBOK-aligned structure:</p><pre><code><code>Project/
│
├── 01-Initiation/
├── 02-Planning/
├── 03-Execution/
├── 04-Monitoring/
└── CLAUDE.md
</code></code></pre><p>Everything else hangs off this.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>The document skills game-changer</strong></p><p>Anthropic’s <em>document skills</em> let Claude create:<br><strong>Word docs, Excel sheets, PowerPoints, PDFs</strong><br>—directly from your markdown.</p><p>My workflow:<br><strong>Draft fast in markdown → export polished client documents.</strong></p><blockquote><p><em>“Convert project-charter.md into a formatted .docx with cover page, TOC, and styled tables.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Result: client-ready documents.</p><p>They’re 80–90% perfect. I do a final polish.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>The CLAUDE.md file (your secret weapon)</strong></p><p>This file trains Claude on your project:</p><pre><code><code># Project Context
## Overview  
## Stakeholders  
## Current Phase  
## Standards  
## Preferences
</code></code></pre><p>It takes 5 minutes to update but dramatically improves quality.</p><p>Claude gives better outputs when it knows <em>you</em>.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>What this actually costs</strong></p><p>Be honest: Claude Code isn’t free and isn’t effortless.</p><p><strong>Financial:</strong><br>R300–1500/month depending on usage.</p><p><strong>Time:</strong><br>Setup: 2–3 hours<br>Learning curve: 1 week<br>Per project: 30–60 minutes<br>Weekly upkeep: 5–10 minutes</p><p><strong>Technical:</strong><br>Must be comfortable with basic terminal commands.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>What this actually feels like</strong></p><p><strong>The good:</strong><br>– Documents that took hours now take minutes<br>– Better risk visibility<br>– More strategic thinking time<br>– I can manage more projects without burnout</p><p><strong>The tricky:</strong><br>– Prompting requires intention<br>– Generic prompts produce generic rubbish<br>– Tools amplify your expertise—they don’t replace it</p><p><strong>The limitations:</strong><br>– Sometimes misunderstands local context<br>– Can misjudge risk levels<br>– Regulatory nuance needs human oversight</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Who this is actually for</strong></p><p><strong>Great fit if:</strong><br>– You produce documents weekly<br>– Your work is information-heavy<br>– You want to eliminate admin drag<br>– You’re willing to learn basic terminal skills</p><p><strong>Not for you if:</strong><br>– You want AI that “just works”<br>– You avoid technical setup<br>– Your work is mostly interpersonal, not document-driven<br>– You expect AI to replace judgement</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Your next move</strong></p><p>If you’re curious:</p><p><strong>Beginners:</strong><br>Learn terminal basics → install Node → return to Claude Code.</p><p><strong>Intermediate:</strong><br>Install Claude Code, get API access, create a simple CLAUDE.md, and start with:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Read this folder and summarise what you understand about the project.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Then build from there.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>The transformation</strong></p><p>Claude Code didn’t make my projects simpler.<br>It made <em>me</em> more leveraged.</p><p>It handles the drafting, structuring, and first-pass analysis—<br>so I can focus on actual decision-making, stakeholder leadership, and professional judgement.</p><p><strong>AI doesn’t replace us.<br>It lets us spend more time being who we’re supposed to be.</strong></p><p>So ask yourself:<br><em>What would you build if the admin wasn’t holding you back?</em></p><p>Pick one document and try Claude Code on it this week.</p><div><hr></div><p><em>I’m building a full PM guide for Claude Code—templates, prompts, workflows.<br>If you’re experimenting, reply with your experience.
