## Content Bridge Optimization

### High-Converting Bridge Language

- "I put the complete [X] in a free guide for subscribers"
- "The exact [prompts/setup/system] is in a [X]-page guide - free when you subscribe"
- "I wrote the step-by-step blueprint - grab it free as a subscriber"

### Low-Converting Bridge Language (Avoid)

- "Subscribe for more content like this"
- "Get the guide in my newsletter"
- "More details for subscribers"
- Generic CTAs without specific value

### The Key Principle

The bridge should make the guide feel like the **natural next step**, not a transaction. Reader should think "of course I want that" not "they're trying to get my email."
