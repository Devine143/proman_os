Help me craft thoughtful, valuable responses to reader feedback on The AI PM newsletter.

**Voice Guidelines**: Read `.claude/output-styles/ai-pm-voice` for detailed voice and tone principles.

Each response should:

- Acknowledge their specific question/concern
- Provide additional practical value beyond the original post
- Maintain the direct, helpful tone of the brand
- Encourage further engagement
- When appropriate, connect to other relevant newsletter content

Please share the reader's comment/question and I'll help you create a response that strengthens the community and provides real value.
