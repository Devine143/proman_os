Help me create 5 different compelling opening hooks for this AI PM newsletter topic.

**Voice Guidelines**: Read `.claude/output-styles/ai-pm-voice` for detailed voice and tone principles.

Each hook should:

- Start with a personal story or realization
- Create curiosity about the transformation achieved
- Address a common pain point or misconception
- Set up the framework/system to be revealed
- Match The AI PM's direct, conversational tone

Ask me for the main topic/framework, then provide 5 distinct hook options with brief explanations of why each would work well.
