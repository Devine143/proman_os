Help me create a free tier AI PM newsletter post outline that establishes authority and demonstrates AI possibilities without giving away implementation details.

## Pyramid Principle: Insight-First Structure

**CRITICAL: Lead with the transformation, not the story.**

The reader should understand the value proposition within the first 2 sentences. Personal stories prove the insight - they don't replace it.

### Structure (Pyramid-Based)

```
1. THE INSIGHT (Lead with this)
   One sentence stating the transformation/result/discovery
   Example: "I reduced project research time by 70% using a single AI workflow."

2. THE HOOK (Prove the insight with story)
   Personal story that demonstrates WHY the insight is true
   Keep it brief - 2-3 paragraphs max

3. THE FRAMEWORK (MECE-structured)
   High-level methodology organized in logical groups:
   - What it is (the system)
   - Why it works (the principle)
   - What it replaces (the old way)

4. THE EVIDENCE (Support each claim)
   Results and benefits achieved
   Quantify wherever possible

5. THE TEASER (Create demand)
   What's possible with proper implementation
   Specific capabilities without how-to details

6. THE CTA (Clear action)
   Call-to-action for paid tier implementation guide
```

### Insight-First Checklist

Before finalizing the outline, verify:
- [ ] First sentence states the main insight/transformation
- [ ] Reader knows the value within 10 seconds
- [ ] Story supports the insight (not the other way around)
- [ ] Framework sections are MECE (no overlap, complete coverage)
- [ ] Each claim has evidence/result attached
- [ ] CTA is specific and compelling

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Starting with "I was sitting at my desk when..." (story before insight)
- Burying the result at the end (inverted pyramid)
- Vague claims without numbers ("it saved me tons of time")
- Framework sections that overlap or have gaps

Ask me what AI system, tool, or workflow result I want to showcase, then create the complete outline with suggested content for each section using the Pyramid Principle structure above.
