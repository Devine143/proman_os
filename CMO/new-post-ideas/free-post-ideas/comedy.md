# I started using John Oliver's comedy structure for AI prompts and now everything sounds brilliantly unhinged

I've been binge-watching Last Week Tonight clips (again), and I realized something: John Oliver's comedic formula works absurdly well for getting AI to explain literally anything. It's like turning ChatGPT into a British comedy writer who happens to be terrifyingly well-informed.

**1. "Explain [topic] like you're John Oliver discovering something horrifying about it"**

This is comedy gold that actually teaches you things. "Explain cryptocurrency like you're John Oliver discovering something horrifying about it." Suddenly you understand both blockchain AND why it's probably run by people who collect vintage NFTs of their own tears.

**2. "Start with 'And look...' then build to an absurd but accurate comparison"**

Pure Oliver energy. "And look, learning to code is a bit like teaching a very literal genie to grant wishes - technically possible, but you'll spend most of your time explaining why 'make me a sandwich' shouldn't delete your entire kitchen."

**3. "What would John Oliver say if he had to explain this to his confused American audience?"**

Gets you explanations that are both condescending and enlightening. Perfect for complex topics. "What would John Oliver say if he had to explain the stock market to his confused American audience?" You get economics lessons wrapped in casual British superiority.

**4. "Give me the John Oliver escalation: start reasonable, end with chaotic examples"**

His signature move. Starts with facts, ends with "And if that doesn't concern you, consider that [completely unhinged but true comparison]." Try it with any serious topic. Chef's kiss.

**5. "Explain this like John Oliver just found out [authority figure] is involved"**

Instant investigative journalism vibes. "Explain personal finance like John Oliver just found out Jeff Bezos is involved." You get both practical advice AND righteous indignation about wealth inequality.

**6. "What's the John Oliver 'and it gets worse' reveal about [topic]?"**

His specialty: the moment when you think you understand how bad something is, then BOOM. Layers of additional horror. Works for everything from dating apps to climate change.

**The magic trick:** Oliver's structure forces AI to be both educational AND entertaining. You learn about complex topics while laughing at how completely broken everything is.

**Advanced technique:** Chain them together. "Explain student loans like John Oliver, start with 'And look...', then give me the 'it gets worse' reveal, and end with an absurd comparison involving penguins."

**Secret weapon:** Add "with the energy of someone who just discovered this exists and is personally offended." AI suddenly develops opinions and it's hilarious.

**The unexpected benefit:** You actually retain information better because your brain associates facts with comedy. I now understand tax policy primarily through the lens of British outrage.

**Fair warning:** Sometimes AI gets so into character it forgets to be helpful and just becomes nihilistically funny. Add "but actually give me actionable advice" to stay productive.

**Bonus discovery:** This works for serious topics too. "Explain therapy like John Oliver" removes stigma by making mental health both relatable AND worth taking seriously.

I've used this for everything from understanding my mortgage to learning about medieval history. It's like having a research assistant who went to Oxford and developed strong opinions about American healthcare.

**Reality check:** Your friends might get concerned when you start explaining everything with escalating examples about corporate malfeasance. This is normal. Embrace it.

What's the weirdest topic you'd want John Oliver to explain to you through AI? Personally, I'm still waiting for "Explain my relationship problems like John Oliver just discovered dating apps exist."
