Hey everyone!

I built a free web app with ClaudeAI to export prompt logs for Claude users and would love some feedback from the community:

https://prompt-export-free.com

Exports your Claude prompt history into clean, professional-looking PDFs (great for documentation, sharing prompts, or keeping a personal archive)

Upload the .JSONL file in @ user/.claude/projects/* andgive it a try!

Let me know what you think!

*This app runs entirely in your browser using DuckDB WASM.
