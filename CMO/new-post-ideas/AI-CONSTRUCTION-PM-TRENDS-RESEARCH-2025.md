# AI-Powered Construction PM Trends Research Report
**Date:** 2025-11-28
**Prepared for:** Proman Project Management / "The AI PM" Newsletter
**Research Scope:** Current trends in AI + Construction Project Management with newsletter content opportunities

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The construction industry is experiencing a **radical acceleration in AI adoption**. Between 2023 and 2025, the percentage of construction PMs using AI jumped from 37% to 100%, with sentiment shifting from skepticism to enthusiasm (62% now view AI impact as "very positive" vs. 6% in 2023). This represents a once-in-a-generation shift creating massive content opportunities for "The AI PM" newsletter.

**Key Insight:** The industry has moved past "Is AI useful?" to "How do I implement it?" - creating demand for practical, implementation-focused content exactly aligned with Proman's positioning.
