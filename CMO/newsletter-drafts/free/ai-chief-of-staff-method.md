# Most AI Project Management Advice Is Wrong

Last month, I inherited a disaster.

A multi-stakeholder construction project landed on my desk at the worst possible moment. The previous PM had left. Documentation was scattered across emails, WhatsApp threads, and someone's personal Google Drive. We had six weeks until a critical milestone, and I was staring at what looked like organized chaos—emphasis on the chaos.

The old me would have done what I always did: clear the weekend, build a spreadsheet empire, and emerge on Monday with bloodshot eyes and a plan held together by caffeine and stubborn will.

Instead, I tried something I'd been skeptical about.

I sat down with Claude for 45 minutes. I dumped everything I knew about the project—the stakeholders, the constraints, the half-finished deliverables, the political landmines. And I asked it to help me think through the structure.

What came back wasn't just a task list. It was a complete project framework: phased roadmap, risk register, RACI chart, communication schedule, and a progress tracker I could actually use.

I tweaked it. Added context only I knew. But the heavy cognitive lifting? AI handled that.

Six weeks later, we hit the milestone. Not without surprises—a supplier delay nearly derailed week four—but I wasn't scrambling. The structure held. I had bandwidth to solve problems instead of discovering them.

That's when something clicked. I wasn't using AI as a fancy assistant. I was using it as a **Chief of Staff**—the kind of strategic partner who takes your vision and builds the scaffolding to make it real.

But this isn't about me. This is a pattern I see everywhere—and understanding it changes everything.

## The Gap Where Projects Go to Die

Here's a pattern I see constantly, both in myself and in every leader I work with:

**The vision is the fun part. The execution is where things fall apart.**

You have a brilliant idea. You can see exactly what success looks like. But between that vision and the finished outcome lies a wasteland of tasks, dependencies, deadlines, stakeholder expectations, and the thousand micro-decisions that determine whether something actually ships.

Most of us cope by becoming task managers. We build elaborate systems. We create spreadsheets. We schedule check-ins. We become the bottleneck—the person who has to touch everything because no one else has the full picture.

And our teams know it. They're waiting on us. They can feel the friction.

The worst part? This isn't a failure of intelligence or work ethic. It's a failure of **cognitive capacity**. There's simply too much to hold in your head while also leading people and making strategic decisions.

When most people think about AI for project management, they think small: "Summarize these meeting notes." "Draft this email." "Create a task list."

That's using a Formula 1 car to drive to the grocery store.

The real opportunity isn't task automation. It's **cognitive offloading**—handing the structural thinking to AI so you can focus on what actually requires human judgment: leading people, navigating politics, making decisions with incomplete information.

## The AI Chief of Staff Method

I've refined this into what I call the **AI Chief of Staff Method**—three phases that build a system to manage execution while you focus on leadership.

### Phase 1: Strategy & Planning

This is where most project chaos originates—not in execution, but in fuzzy thinking at the start.

AI excels at taking your half-formed ideas and forcing structure onto them. Not by being creative, but by being relentlessly systematic. When you describe a project to AI, it asks the questions you forgot to ask yourself:

- What are the actual phases here?
- What depends on what?
- What does success look like at each stage?
- Who needs to be involved, and when?

The output isn't a perfect plan. It's a **thinking scaffold**—a structure you can react to, refine, and own. Much easier than staring at a blank page.

What used to take me days of mental wrestling now happens in a focused conversation. I walk away with phases, milestones, deliverables, and a timeline I can actually defend to stakeholders.

### Phase 2: Risk & Resource Management

Here's where AI becomes genuinely valuable: surfacing the blind spots you're too close to see.

Every project has risks. Dependencies that could slip. Stakeholders who might create friction. Technical challenges that look simple until they're not. The problem is, when you're deep in a project, you can't see these clearly. You're too invested in your own assumptions.

AI has no emotional investment in your plan. It will ask uncomfortable questions:

- What happens if this vendor delays?
- Who's the backup if your key person is unavailable?
- Where are you assuming best-case scenarios?

I now run every project plan through a "stress test" conversation before committing to timelines. Not because AI knows my business better than I do—it doesn't. But because it systematically surfaces the questions I need to answer before reality surfaces them for me.

### Phase 3: Execution & Tracking

This is where most AI advice falls flat. "Use AI to track your tasks" sounds great until you realize it means manually copying information back and forth.

The real unlock is building **communication infrastructure** that runs without you.

- Weekly check-in templates that capture the right information
- Stakeholder updates that write themselves from project data
- Progress trackers that actually get maintained
- Post-mortem frameworks that capture real learnings

Here's a concrete example: Every Friday, I paste my project tracker into Claude and ask it to draft a stakeholder update highlighting progress, flagging risks, and proposing decisions needed. What used to take me 45 minutes of context-switching now takes 5 minutes of review and refinement. The quality is better because I'm editing rather than creating from scratch.

The goal isn't automating yourself out of the project. It's automating the **administrative friction** so your interactions with the team are about decisions and direction, not status updates.

When this is working, you stop being the project's central nervous system. You become its strategic brain—still essential, but not a bottleneck.

### Where This Breaks Down

Let me be honest about limitations, because overselling AI helps no one.

This approach works best when you have **domain knowledge to evaluate AI output**. If you're new to an industry, AI will generate confident-sounding plans that miss critical context. In construction, for example, it won't know your local municipal approval timelines, your specific subcontractor dynamics, or which JBCC clauses will bite you later.

It also struggles with **highly novel projects** where there's no established pattern to draw from, and **heavily regulated environments** where compliance details matter more than structure.

Use AI to structure your thinking, not replace your expertise. The human in the loop isn't optional—it's the whole point.

## What This Actually Changes (When It Works)

Let me be transparent about results, because I hate vague promises.

**Time savings are real but not the point.** Yes, I can now generate a comprehensive project plan in under an hour instead of spreading it across days. That matters. But it's not the transformation.

**The transformation is capacity.**

When you're not spending mental energy on structural thinking, you have more bandwidth for the things that actually require human judgment:

- Difficult conversations with underperforming team members
- Political navigation with stakeholders
- Creative problem-solving when plans hit reality
- Noticing when someone on your team is struggling

I'm not faster at project management. I've **fundamentally changed how I approach it**. AI handles the structure. I handle the strategy and the humans.

The shift feels less like efficiency and more like **upgrading your operating system**. You're not doing the same work faster—you're doing fundamentally different work.

## What's Possible (A Taste)

I've distilled this approach into a systematic toolkit:

**10 foundational prompts** that walk you through the entire project lifecycle—from breaking down the big picture to conducting post-mortems that actually improve future projects.

**Plus one "mega-prompt"** that acts like a world-class Chief of Staff on demand. Feed it your project context, and it generates a comprehensive, board-room-ready plan: executive summary, phased roadmap, work breakdown structure, RACI chart, risk register, communication plan, and tracking dashboard.

The kind of output that makes executives ask, "Wait, you did this yourself?"

## Try This Now

Before you open another spreadsheet or scheduling tool, try this:

**Next time you have a project brewing,** spend 15 minutes describing it to Claude or ChatGPT. Don't ask for a task list. Ask it to:

> "Break this project into clear phases with goals, timelines, and key milestones for each phase. Then identify the three biggest risks and what questions I should be asking before committing to this plan."

See what comes back.

That's a taste of what's possible when you stop using AI as a task assistant and start using it as a thinking partner.

*The shift from task manager to strategic leader doesn't happen overnight. But it starts with a single conversation. What would you build first if AI handled the structure?*
